xml:lang="EN-US">Don Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala, the author and
artist of <i>El primer nueva cor&oacute;nica y buen gobierno</i>
(completed 1615, emended 1616), was a person of unlimited
aspirations. He expressed the hope that his 1200-page chronicle
would be placed &ldquo;in the archive&rdquo; as a testimony to past
events and a guide to the pursuit of justice. He specified that it
should be preserved &ldquo;in the archive of heaven as of the
world,&rdquo; that is, in Rome, at the head of Christiandom, and in
Castile, headquarters of all earthly power. His more immediate hope
had been for its publication, that is, that Spain&rsquo;s king
Philip III would serve as his patron and have the work printed
&ldquo;to make immortal the memory and name of the great ancient
lords&rdquo; of Peru. Guaman Poma&rsquo;s exuberant work with its
many purposes would not be published for three hundred years, and,
after many print editions (Paris, Oruro, Bolivia, Mexico City,
Caracas, Madrid, Lima), its truly global reach would not be
achieved until the new millenium: the 2001 digitization of his
autograph manuscript by the Royal Library of
Copenhagen.</span></a></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=
"mso-layout-grid-align:none;punctuation-wrap:simple; text-autospace:none">
<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">The digitized edition of Guaman
Poma&rsquo;s <i>Nueva cor&oacute;nica y buen gobierno</i>
manuscript (GkS 2232 4&ordm;) is one of the marvels of the Internet
era. Its freshness and immediacy carry new readers eagerly through
its portal. Its complete accessibility draws its most veteran
students and scholars to renewed inquiries and new questions. In
this light, and as a complement to the digitization project, I
planned to update my 1977 review of the autograph manuscript, which
appeared in the 1979-80 volume of <i style=
"mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Fund og Forskning</i> and has now been
placed in facsimile on this website. Thanks, however, to being
invited to participate in preparing the Royal Library&rsquo;s
2001-2002 codicological survey of the Guaman Poma codex (see
summary in Section 1, below), I have been able to entertain new
questions and not simply modify previous understandings. My aim
herein is to coordinate the physical characteristics of the
<i>Nueva cor&oacute;nica y buen gobierno</i> manuscript with its
contents, that is, to integrate Guaman Poma&rsquo;s vision of
Peru&rsquo;s ancient past, its precarious present, and uncertain
future with his construction and emendation of the manuscript that
conveys it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=
"mso-layout-grid-align:none;punctuation-wrap:simple; text-autospace:none">
<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">This articulation of
codicological and textual evidence has yielded several major
results. First, it foregrounds and reinforces the character of
Guaman Poma&rsquo;s authorship as the enterprise, single-minded in
purpose and execution, of a sole individual. Although I set forth
this hypothesis in my earlier bibliographic investigation of the
manuscript (Adorno 1979-80, 17, 27, note 8), the present
coordination of codicological and textual evidence reveals
systematically how the work was created, corrected, augmented, and
updated, and that it was done by his hand alone. Second, this
coordination of material and textual evidence reveals for the first
time how Guaman Poma handled the scarcity of material resources
during the final stages of his work and how he dealt with the
competing priorities of informational accuracy and graphic design.
Third, in relation to the three great divisions of the work (the
<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Nueva cor&oacute;nica</i> of
ancient Andean history,<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> the &ldquo;Conquista&rdquo;
account of the Spanish conquest, and the <i style=
"mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Buen gobierno</i> <span style=
"mso-bidi-font-style: italic">treatise on colonial reform), the
dual, codicological/textual analysis makes evident the growing
importance that Guaman Poma attached to the</span> <i style=
"mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Buen gobierno.</i> In particular, it
reveals the importance of its inaugural chapter and the strategic,
historical role that Guaman Poma assigned to the viceroy Don Juan
de Mendoza y Luna, the marquis of Montesclaros, the eleventh
viceroy of Peru (1607-1615). This result allows us to reemphasize
Guaman Poma&rsquo;s ultimate realization of his work as a treatise
on &ldquo;good government,&rdquo; as one among many privately
authored <i>arbitrios</i> written on Spanish imperial
reform.</span></p>

In this section I examine the history of the manuscript in the
Royal Library, including its classification in the Old Royal
Collection, its &ldquo;rediscovery&rdquo; and provenence, and its
facsimile reproduction by the Institut d&rsquo;Ethnologie in Paris
with the help of the Royal Library. This discussion sets a new date
for the Royal Library&rsquo;s acquisition of the manuscript. It
also reexamines the character and quality of the Paris facsimile
edition by which Guaman Poma&rsquo;s work was most well known from
1936 until the appearance in 1980 of the Murra/Adorno and Pease
editions of the <i>Nueva cor&oacute;nica y buen

<b><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">4. Final Renderings: The
Coordination of Codicological and Textual Evidence</span></b><br />
Scrutinizing the final emendations that Guaman Poma made to his
manuscript, I explore in this section the necessarily close
relationship between the codicological evidence of the manuscript
and Guaman Poma&rsquo;s conceptual formulation and redaction of his
work.In particular, I test the capacity of the new codicological
data to reveal or support the textual evidence of Guaman
Poma&rsquo;s growing concerns as he reached the end of his project
and closed his book for the last time. The results of this analysis
modify the familiar profile of the utopian-minded Andean who would
make his son the &ldquo;prince of the Indies&rdquo; and reveal
instead the hard-headed, well informed advocate of comprehensive
administrative reform aimed at relieving the crushing labor and
tribute demands on the native population.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Studying
the successive modifications of the physical manuscript in light of
its textual contents transforms the static artifact into a living
testimony. It is for this reason that I have described Guaman

facsimile. Its extraordinarily high quality makes its consultation
a necessary complement to this essay as well as the appropriate
source for any future manuscript analysis of the <i>Nueva

visible many details of Guaman Poma&rsquo;s graphic and prose texts
that otherwise would go unnoticed, and it has proved to be

the &ldquo;o&rdquo; of &ldquo;primero&rdquo; and the conjunction

black ink, decorative motifs that obscure them (<a target="Caption"

Guaman Poma divided his work into chapters but he did not number

(&ldquo;Table [of contents] of the said chronicle&rdquo;) diverges
from the body of the text insofar as the &ldquo;Tabla&rdquo; fails
to list certain chapters or sections of chapters and reorganizes
the presentation of others into a different format (see Section
3.5, below). The chapter references I cite below refer to the
numbered, descriptive chapter titles that John Charles and I
created as a bilingual, Spanish-English &ldquo;Tabla de

The three sides of the book block have been cut evenly in

top of the book block have been truncated by this procedure, care
was taken to avoid removing from the bottom of the book block the
lines of text that occasionally extend deep into the page beyond
Guaman Poma&rsquo;s customary lower margin. These portions of text
were preserved by making a vertical scissors-cut in the sheet along
the gutter of the book and folding this bottom portion of the sheet
back up onto itself. Thus the book block could be cut without
risking the excision of valuable text. Some pages were inevitably
overlooked in this process, and the cutting of the book block
resulted in the truncation of some sheets&rsquo; textual contents.

binding<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">procedures. Physical
evidence in the book points to at least four binding operations
during the nearly four hundred years of the codex's existence (see
Section 2.4, below). In connection with these binding activities,
certain elements were assembled incorrectly, and other elements
that previously had been tucked loosely into the manuscript were
secured more effectively, either by pasting (three cases: actual
pages 466-467, 978-981, 1188-1189), by stitching (two cases: actual
pages 474-475 and 1104-1139 [</span></a><a name=

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">We can be
assured, however, that all the elements are today located in their

Guaman Poma gave all possible cues to their proper sequential
arrangement at every stage of his work. In this fortunate
situation, the understanding of the process of Guaman Poma&rsquo;s
redaction and emendation of his work is not dependent on knowing
whether a particular stitching or pasting was done by him or by
subsequent binders who have successfully accomplished his

of these single sheets, actual pages 466-467 and 1188-1189, have
been added to the quires by pasting their narrow flap to the

double sheet, because its carelessly cut, uneven edge does not
resemble the more evenly cut edges of the single sheets that had
been cut with great care in preparation for their assembly into,
and use as, composite double sheets. While the stitching into quire
10 of the single sheet that became pages 474-475 undoubtedly

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">The
1784-86 Erichsen catalog (vol. 3, pp. 606-618) was the first to
give the <i>Nueva cor&oacute;nica y buen gobierno</i> a subject
classification (see also Section 2.2, below). Folio, quarto, and
octavo items were catalogued in separate groups, but they all
followed the same subject classification scheme. In the system used
by Erichsen, the pertinent subject category was
&ldquo;History,&rdquo; and it was divided into
&ldquo;Universal,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ancient,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Recent,&rdquo; with &ldquo;Recent History&rdquo; being
further subdivided according to country. Spanish and Portuguese
materials of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were
classified together because of<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> Portugal&rsquo;s 1580-1668
incorporation under the Spanish crown. Since Erichsen&rsquo;s
catalog antedates Latin American independence from Spain by some
three decades, Spain&rsquo;s overseas possessions, including Peru
and the former Inka empire, were automatically subsumed under
&ldquo;Spain,&rdquo; the imperial &ldquo;mother&rdquo; country.
Erichsen thus placed Guaman Poma&rsquo;s manuscript book in the
category of &ldquo;Recent Spanish and Portuguese History.&rdquo;
Since there are other listings of chronicles in this category, it
is likely that the work&rsquo;s Spanish-language title,
&ldquo;Cor&oacute;nica,&rdquo; determined, at least in part, its

classification of his work in a learned library instead of its use

<span style="color:black">As we saw at the outset of this essay, he
aspired to have his work preserved both as a celebration of the
Andean historical past and a contemporary guide to good governance

first recorded &ldquo;archival&rdquo; classification met the
challenge, at least with regard to the recognition of his dual
subject matter of history and politics. Although the work was not
archived permanently, as Guaman Poma desired, <i>in</i> Spain
(&ldquo;cauesa del mundo,&rdquo; or &ldquo;head of earthly

If Erichsen&rsquo;s 1784-86 catalog offered the first
classification of Guaman Poma&rsquo;s manuscript, it was not the
first notice of the work in the Royal Library&rsquo;s records. For
nearly a century the Royal Library&rsquo;s manuscript catalog of
1784-86 has provided the earliest date by which the <i>Nueva

Royal Collection could be verified. Now, thanks to the recent
investigations of the Danish historian, former Research Librarian
at the Royal Library Harald Ils&oslash;e, we know that the <i>Nueva
cor&oacute;nica y buen gobierno</i> had already appeared in an
earlier catalog of the Royal Library, dated 1729. In his recently

Ils&oslash;e (1999, 77) announced that this comprehensive

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style=

the 1729 catalog, the listing of the <i>Nueva cor&oacute;nica</i>
there cannot be considered as a subject classification. It appears
as number 46 in a miscellaneous list whose topics, in items 40
through 54, include: a dissertation on the kabbala, a work on
political theory, a numismatics catalog, a verse-eulogy to king
Frederick III of Denmark, an introduction to the Hebrew language, a
work of Muslim history, a list of Ethiopian kings, a description of
Venice, an introduction to the art of military fortification,
several treatises on the arts of war, a work about the Netherlands,
and an exposition on Swedish law. The languages represented include
Latin, French, Danish, and German, as well as Guaman Poma&rsquo;s
Spanish.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style=
"mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Importantly, though,
1729 now stands as the new, undeniable date by which the autograph
manuscript had entered the Danish royal collections. This fact, in
turn, makes more plausible the speculation about the <i>Nueva
cor&oacute;nica y buen gobierno&rsquo;</i>s arrival in Denmark in
the seventeenth century. Under such circumstances, the range of
potential donors would be necessarily limited, pointing to
Cornelius Lerche (1615-1681), who served as Danish ambassador to
Spain from 1650 to 1655 and from 1658 to 1662.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style=
"mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Decades ago, the
Peruvian historian Ra&uacute;l Porras Barrenechea (1948, 79)
mentioned Lerche as a possible donor, and Harald
Ils&oslash;e&rsquo;s recent bibliographic investigations also lead
in this direction. Although, as Ils&oslash;e acknowledges, his
observations provide only circumstantial evidence, I consider them
sufficiently suggestive to be pertinent to this discussion and
potentially fruitful for the ongoing investigation of the
provenance of the <i>Nueva cor&oacute;nica y buen gobierno</i>
manuscript in the Danish Royal Library. In a personal communication
to me of 13 May 2001, Mr. Ils&oslash;e wrote: &ldquo;The items on
the shelves around the Guaman Poma manuscript in 1729 indicate that
it was acquired under king Frederick III (1648-1670), that is, most
probably before 1663, since the work does not appear in an extant
list of acquisitions (&ldquo;E 8&rdquo; in the archive of the Royal
Library) covering the period 1663-1671.&rdquo;<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> In a personal letter of 26 May
2001, Mr. Ils&oslash;e spelled out his line of
reasoning:</span></p>

xml:lang="EN-US">The arguments for a king Frederick III provenance
are still only circumstantial evidence and not proofs. Perhaps most
important is the following fact . . . .: Except for the
acquisitions from the Coyet and Reitzer collections, the manuscript
acquisitions under Frederick IV (1699-1730) are apparently listed
together in E 20, vol. 2, pp. 562-564 (cf. Ils&oslash;e 1999, 604
and 614-618), indicating that the Guaman Poma manuscript (listed in
E 20, vol. 2, p. 687) was acquired at the latest by ca. 1700. The
chain of circumstantial evidence is as follows: (1) The acquisition
was probably made before 1700, and (2) it most probably occurred
under Frederick III, in 1663, at the latest. &nbsp;</span></p>

manuscripts, are excluded as earlier possessors. The acquisitions

either the manuscript was acquired together with the library of

printed books), or that it was a well-chosen gift to Frederick III
from Lerche, when he returned from Spain at the end of
1662.</span></p>

xml:lang="EN-US">Having been knighted in 1660, Lerche had good
reason to express his gratitude to the king. The fact that Lerche
owned manuscripts from the library of the Count-Duke of Olivares as
well as a manuscript written in an &ldquo;Indian&rdquo; language
(Ils&oslash;e 1999, 364, no. 30), brings his Spanish collection
into a higher class than any other collection taken from Spain to
Denmark up to that point in time. We know, furthermore, that
Gersdorff acquired Spanish books through Lerche, so either
possibility points to an acquisition by Lerche, who was in Madrid
during the years 1650-1662, except for a hiatus between 1655 and
1658.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style=
"mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">The manuscript in an
&ldquo;Indian&rdquo; language referred to by Ils&oslash;e above is
a collection of sermons, &ldquo;Sermones sobre los Evangelios y
fiestas del anno en lengua Matalzingne [<i>sic</i>] de las
Indias,&rdquo; written in the Amerindian language of Matlazinca.
Located in today&rsquo;s northeast Michoac&aacute;n, Mexico, the
area was known in the sixteenth century as Matalcingo (Gerhard
1993, 106); it was the site of production of Spanish missionary
works in the Matlazinca language, including dramatic plays of the
life of Christ (Edmonson 1985, 5). Lerche&rsquo;s possession of
this collection of sermons on the Christian gospel and liturgical
feasts might or might not suggest an interest on his part in
indigenous, precolumbian America; it could have been simply,
coincidentally, among other manuscript materials that he
collected.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style=
"mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">It is of great interest
that Lerche owned manuscripts acquired from the library of Don
Gaspar de Guzm&aacute;n (1587-1645), the Count-Duke of Olivares,
the statesman and principal minister of Spain&rsquo;s king Philip
IV (1621-1665). As mentioned by Ils&oslash;e (1999, 360-364), no
less than six of the forty-six Spanish and Italian manuscripts
listed in the 1682 auction catalog of Lerche&rsquo;s personal book
collection derive from Olivares&rsquo; library.
Ils&oslash;e&rsquo;s findings and inferences thus keep alive Porras
Barrenechea&rsquo;s (1948, 79) conjecture that it was Cornelius
Lerche who acquired the <i>Nueva cor&oacute;nica y buen
gobierno</i> manuscript in Spain between 1650 and 1662.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style=
"mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">One more piece of
circumstantial evidence perhaps points to Lerche as donor. In 1993,
Ils&oslash;e announced that Daniel Gotthilf Moldenhawer
(1753-1823), the renowned director of the Royal Library from 1788
to 1823, had &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; the <i>Nueva cor&oacute;nica
y buen gobierno</i> more than a century earlier than Pietschmann
and that he had hoped to publish segments of it (Ils&oslash;e 1993,
28-32). Moldenhawer&rsquo;s intervention was not gratuitous; he
would have become aware of the potential value of the <i>Nueva
cor&oacute;nica y buen gobierno</i> because of his own Hispanist
interests. He was the first director of the Royal Library to be
well acquainted with Spanish language and culture, having spent two
periods in Spain (1783-84, 1786-87), for the purposes,
respectively, of scholarly investigation and diplomatic
negotiation. He collected approximately 150 Spanish documents for a
history of the Spanish Inquisition that he proposed to write but
never accomplished. That collection of Inquisition materials was
unequaled in Europe until twenty years later, when the Napoleonic
wars opened Spain&rsquo;s Inquisition archives (Henningsen 1975-76,
249-250).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style=
"mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Moldenhawer's knowledge
of Guaman Poma can be deduced from his 1809 project for publication
of a &ldquo;Museum&rdquo; of manuscript treasures of the Royal
Library. This series of volumes was to include &ldquo;Information
on and samples from a chronicle of Peru that includes the history
of the Inkas and the conquest of this kingdom, with a description
of its domestic affairs illustrated with drawings&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Efterretning om og Pr&oslash;ver af en Kr&oslash;nike af
Peru, som indbefatter Ynkaernes og dette Riges Erobrings Historie,
med en ved Tegninger oplyst Beskrivelse om dets indre
M&aelig;rkv&aelig;rdigheder&rdquo;). This mention of
Moldenhawer&rsquo;s 1809 project in 1825 by his successor, Erich
Christian Werlauff (1823-1861), is the first printed Royal Library
reference to the <i>Nueva cor&oacute;nica y buen gobierno</i>
(Werlauff 1825, 352; Werlauff 1844, 333).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style=
"mso-ansi-language:EN-GB" xml:lang="EN-GB">Ils&oslash;e (1993) has
also found Guaman Poma&rsquo;s work mentioned in the diary of
August Hennings, a German civil servant visiting Copenhagen in
1802. Excerpts from this diary were published in 1934. According to
Hennings, Moldenhawer held the opinion that the <i>Nueva
cor&oacute;nica y buen gobierno</i>, like other Spanish manuscripts
in the Royal Library, had been &ldquo;bought from the library left
by a Spanish ambassador, a learned man who died in
Copenhagen&rdquo; (&ldquo;aus dem angekauften Nachlasse eines in
Copenhagen verstorbenen spanischen Gesandten, der ein gelehrter
Mann war&rdquo;). Unfortunately, Hennings&rsquo; account does not
specify whether Moldenhawer had in mind an ambassador from or a
(Danish) ambassador to Spain nor whether, as<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> Ils&oslash;e points out,
Moldenhawer&rsquo;s view of the <i>Nueva
cor&oacute;nica</i>&rsquo;s provenance was conjectural or based on
documentary evidence now lost.</span> <span lang="EN-GB" style=

xml:lang="EN-US">Despite this early discovery of Guaman
Poma&rsquo;s work in the Royal Library, a monumental silence
prevailed around the Peruvian manuscript until its
&ldquo;rediscovery&rdquo; by Pietschmann in 1908. The only probable
activity concerning the manuscript between Moldenhawer&rsquo;s time
and Pietschmann&rsquo;s was the rebinding of the manuscript during
the later years of Werlauff&rsquo;s directorship (see Section 2.4,
below). Werlauff likely ordered the task to be done because his
predecessor Moldenhawer had esteemed the work and hoped to publish
extracts from it.</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" style=

xml:lang="EN-US">The late (1908) date of the enduring recognition
of the codex after its centuries-long residence in the Royal
Library is one of the factors that suggests its inclusion in a
&ldquo;closed&rdquo; collection soon after its arrival in Denmark.
The absence of any owners&rsquo; marks or readers&rsquo;
annotations on the manuscript, as well as its overall perfect state
of conservation, likewise support its early deposit and withdrawal
from hand-to-hand circulation. All these considerations stand as
circumstantial evidence supporting the <i>Nueva cor&oacute;nica y
buen gobierno</i>&rsquo;s incorporation into the oldest collections
of the Royal Library probably less than half a century after Guaman
Poma put the finishing touches on it in 1616.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">From 1908
to 1930, however, the manuscript left the Royal Library for
extended periods (see Adorno 1979-80, 19, 27, notes 17-19). The
manuscript went first to G&ouml;ttingen with Richard Pietschmann
for his preparation of a transcription and edition. After
Pietschmann&rsquo;s death in 1923, his heirs eventually arranged
with Dr. Ferdinand Hestermann, then of the Museum f&uuml;r
V&ouml;lkerkunde in Hamburg and later of the University of Jena, to
collate and make a typescript of Pietschmann&rsquo;s transcription
so that his critical edition could be published. The manuscript was
sent to Hestermann in Hamburg in 1927 (Adorno 1979-80, 19, 27, note
19). On 25 January 1930, Hestermann informed the Royal Library that
he had completed his work. When the Head of the Americanist Section
of the Museum f&uuml;r V&ouml;lkerkunde advised the Royal Library
later that spring that it was impossible to foresee a printing date
and that a facsimile edition was being planned, the Royal Library
replied that an agreement had already been made with the University
of Paris for the purpose.</span></p>

learned from the Royal Library&rsquo;s archival documents, which
were not available to me in 1977, that soon after Hestermann
received the codex for collation, he drew the attention of the
Royal Library to three problems: (1) the ordering of the
manuscript&rsquo;s pages was faulty; (2) the <i>mapamundi</i> could
not be spread out due to tight binding (Guaman Poma&rsquo;s pages
983-984 [actual pages 1001-1002]); and (3) the upper portions of
three sheets had been torn out (Guaman Poma&rsquo;s pages 702-703,
820-821, 822-823 [actual pages 716-717, 834-835,

<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">The manuscript was then
returned from Hamburg to Copenhagen, and the Royal Library set to
the task of loosening the binding, reordering the misplaced quires,
and reenforcing the three torn sheets with gummed China paper. At
this time, gummed China paper was also applied to the top portions
of pages that had been damaged by the excessive amounts of ink that
Guaman Poma had applied to them. The reader of the online edition
can view directly the location of the China paper applications,
make note of the three torn sheets, and appreciate the display of
the spectacular <i>mapamundi,</i> now fully open. The problem of
reordering the misassembled quires of the manuscript, however,
requires a few words of explanation.</span></p>

the previous one. First, this final, unanticipated chapter, written

would have been caused when numbering the pages and turning the
leaf before the previous page was dry. This type of ink blotting
would be commonly found <i>within</i> quires, regardless of whether
the book was already bound or consisted of loose quires that still
needed to be sewn together. Such perfectly matched-up ink blots
would not occur <i>between</i> quires if the manuscript were

number on the first (recto) page of another, or vice versa, that
is, the number on the verso page, its ink blot, on the recto.

that he had the manuscript sewn and perhaps bound; (3) that he
subsequently paginated it; and (4) that he then entered the
appropriate page numbers in the spaces in the &ldquo;Tabla&rdquo;
that he had earlier left blank. At a still later point in time he
made the final emendations to his manuscript that I take up in
Section 4, below.</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Aside from
the initial sewing of the manuscript under Guaman Poma&rsquo;s
direct supervision, we can point to a number of other visibly
distinct binding operations. As I noted years ago (Adorno 1979-80,
16, 27, notes 5 and 6), the binding for which we have positive
evidence, in the form of the book block&rsquo;s incised and gilded
edges, is likely to have occurred in the seventeenth century. The
evidence of this early binding has been preserved because the
manuscript&rsquo;s margins were not recut in subsequent binding
operations; the elegant finishing, which was rather uncommon in
Spanish seventeenth-century bindings, was left intact.</span></p>
<span lang="EN-US" style=
"font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;mso-fareast-language: EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA"
xml:lang="EN-US">This binding operation cut and gilded the edges of
the book block and also produced the bottom-fold sheets and
truncated texts mentioned above in &ldquo;Preliminary
Remarks.&rdquo; A thin overlay of gold was then applied to the
book&rsquo;s cut edges, and simple incisions were made to produce
decorative patterns running crosswise to the thickness of the book.
The incised patterns on the book&rsquo;s top and bottom edges are
curved, suggesting that the spine of the book was rounded at the
time of incision, in contrast to its present, flat-spined
binding.</span>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">This
binding activity, done at an unspecified place and point in time
after the manuscript left Guaman Poma&rsquo;s hands, probably
introduced the errors in quire sequence (quire 5 placed after
quires 6-8, and quire 22 set into the midpoint of quire 23) that
would not be rectified until 1927.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">The third
binding as well as the extant leather cover date from the reign of
king Frederick VII (1848-1863), as indicated by the royal emblem
that appears on the spine of the book. (See
&ldquo;Binding/Encuadernaci&oacute;n&rdquo; on this website.) We
may call this the &ldquo;Werlauff binding.&rdquo; Probably acting
on the information that his illustrious predecessor, D.G.
Moldenhawer, had planned to publish parts of the <i>Nueva
cor&oacute;nica y buen gobierno</i> manuscript, Royal Library
Director Erich Werlauff arranged for its rebinding. Thus the
manuscript that Moldenhawer had deemed worthy of study and
publication was newly preserved in the binding cover by which we
know it. Since no one by that date had investigated or studied the
manuscript closely, the errors of quire arrangement were
perpetuated in this mid-nineteenth-century operation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Although
the gold-adorned leather binding was done under Werlauff&rsquo;s
direction in the 1850s, the American historian Philip Ainsworth
Means described the manuscript in the 1920s as being bound in
parchment. Upon recounting his September 1922 visit to</span>
<span lang="EN-US" style="mso-bidi-font-family:Arial" xml:lang=
"EN-US">G&ouml;ttingen to</span> <span lang="EN-US" xml:lang=
"EN-US">see the manuscript in Richard Pietschmann&rsquo;s care,
Means (1923, 398) reported, &ldquo;The bulky work is bound in
ancient parchment.&rdquo; How is this to be explained? When the
manuscript was sent from the Royal Library on extended loan to
Pietschmann in G&ouml;ttingen, it is likely that its leather
binding was sheathed in a special cover to protect it during the
period of Pietschmann&rsquo;s editorial work. In the brief visit
that he paid to Pietschmann in G&ouml;ttingen to peruse the
manuscript, Means may or may not have made conscious note of the
binding and simply reported on it according to an incorrect
recollection. In any case, there is no evidence that the <i>Nueva
cor&oacute;nica</i> appeared in an ancient parchment cover at any
time after the mid-nineteenth century and the application of the
Frederick VII era binding.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">The fourth
major rebinding is the one for which the most complete information
exists. This operation was prompted by Ferdinand Hestermann&rsquo;s
February 1927 notice to the Royal Library that the pages of the
manuscript were misordered. We may conjecture that Pietschmann had
discovered much earlier the faulty page sequence, but that he had
not been hindered by it in the preparation of his transcription.
For anyone reading and transcribing the manuscript as Pietschmann
was doing, the correct sequence would have been readily perceived,
thanks to Guaman Poma&rsquo;s orderly presentation of materials and
his employment of structuring devices (pagination, catchwords,
etc.) that made clear how the manuscript&rsquo;s elements were to
be arranged.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">When in
1927 the Royal Library&rsquo;s conservationists loosened the
binding of the <i>Nueva cor&oacute;nica y buen gobierno</i>
manuscript, reordered its quires, and applied China paper
reenforcements, they did not prepare a new binding cover. Instead,
they simply reapplied the Frederick VII embossed leather binding
which was still well preserved, thanks no doubt to the sleeve that
had protected it during the manuscript&rsquo;s years abroad. The
extant cover shows clear evidence of this reapplication process; it
has received a new paste-down, front and back, and the call number
is written in the hand of Dr. Ellen J&oslash;rgensen (1877-1941),
Curator of Manuscripts from 1914 to 1941. The remains of the
previous paste-down from the Frederick VII era can still be seen
underneath the current one.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">In seeking
to restore the manuscript&rsquo;s intended page sequence,
Hestermann identified the problems and the Royal Library remedied
them with ease because the manuscript itself gave a complete
account of how its pages were to be ordered. Guaman Poma had
employed four structuring tools: (1) a repeatedly updated
pagination of the manuscript; (2) the simultaneous use of a
catchword at the foot of every page to signal the word with which
the next page&rsquo;s text began; (3) the use of running heads,
over virtually every page; and, finally, (4) his carefully prepared
(though not updated) &ldquo;Tabla de la dicha
cor&oacute;nica&rdquo; (actual pages 1179-1189).</span></p>

xml:lang="EN-US">Guaman Poma prepared his manuscript for its
subsequent and eventual handlers (hopefully, in the royal court and
later in the royal printing shop) according to his experience as a
reader of printed books. Above the text block on every page he
penned a running head that contained<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> a key word or words of the
chapter&rsquo;s title; at the foot of the text block on each page,
he employed a catchword. He also carefully corrected catchwords to
correspond to his pages&rsquo; new successors as he inserted new
materials into the manuscript. Along with pagination, he used this
means to indicate the proper placement of his late-added
&ldquo;Camina el autor&rdquo; chapter, for which there remained no
available space in the &ldquo;Tabla&rdquo; to make a desired entry.
With close attention to detail, he modified the catchword on the
page that was to precede the opening of<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> &ldquo;Camina el autor.&rdquo;
Thus, &ldquo;tratemos,&rdquo; which cued the chapter of the months
of the year, is crossed out and &ldquo;a su casa&rdquo; inserted
(actual page 1103), making clear to the careful binder (or reader)
that &ldquo;Camina el autor&rdquo; was to follow the chapter on
<i>tanpu,</i> or royal inns, thus taking the place of the chapter
of the months of the year, which now was to follow &ldquo;Camina el
autor.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Although
not a faithful reproduction of the ultimate contents of his book or
its final pagination, Guaman Poma&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tabla&rdquo;
served as an indispensable tool in determining the intended chapter
sequence. The portion of the &ldquo;Tabla&rdquo; on actual pages
1181-1182, for example, allowed Hestermann to identify, and the
Royal Library to correct, the errors of placement that pertained to
the chapters on Inka institutions. Guaman Poma&rsquo;s efforts to
order his book will be discussed in Section 3.5,

rate of a little more than one man-hour per page, at ten francs per

however, Catin billed the University of Paris for the presumably
completed &ldquo;travaux de retouche&rdquo; in the amount of 36.000

<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Painting out the obtrusive
bleedthroughs was a highly delicate operation. The most difficult
challenge was to eradicate the unwanted penetrations of ink found
in the upper portion of sheets. This area was the most adversely
affected because of the heavily inked calligraphic titles that
Guaman Poma typically created at the top of both sides of the
sheet. The major consequence of &ldquo;painting out&rdquo; in these
areas was, not surprisingly, the loss of serifs and other details
on the letters of Guaman Poma&rsquo;s elaborate calligraphy.
Occasionally, the process had to be undertaken throughout whole
pages. The pictorical account of the general inspection, or census
(chapter 10), is a case in point; the entire pictorial field of
most of the chapter&rsquo;s drawings had been penetrated by the ink
applied to the other side of the sheet.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">The major consequences of
redrawing in the Paris facsimile are as follows (all page numbers
refer to the actual pagination rather than Guaman Poma&rsquo;s
numbering): (1) the usually expertly-done filling in of blank
spaces in the photography caused by the photographic reproduction
of the perforations in the large letters of Guaman Poma&rsquo;s
calligraphic titles; (2) the repeated distortion of particularly
large letters when redrawn, notably the S, the C, and the O, with
the foot of the S and C not quite touching the invisible line on
which Guaman Poma wrote, and the O, foreshortened and floating
above it (Fraser [1996, 285] noted the &ldquo;O&rdquo; problem);
(3) the redrawing of lines representing the sky at the top of the
pictorial field of many drawings because painting out bled-through
images from the other side of the sheet had eradicated them; (4)
the infrequent redrawing of other images appearing in the upper
portions of the pictorial field, such as the plumes on an
Inka&rsquo;s headdress (pp. 96, 260, 263), the horns of a devil
figure (p. 248), a roof line (p. 306), the top of a young
woman&rsquo;s head (p. 225), or the upper portion of the aureola
surrounding an image of the Virgin Mary (p. 717); and (5) the
redrawing of words under the title or on the upper portion of the
pictorial field (e.g. <i style=
"mso-bidi-font-style:normal">quilla,</i> or month [ch. 11; see p.
246]).</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">The most noticeable and
unsuccessful replacement is found on a drawing depicting the
punishment of adulterers. Obscured in the photography or when
painting out bledthrough verso images, Guaman Poma&rsquo;s original
&ldquo;De ADVLTERAS&rdquo; (&ldquo;about adulteresses&rdquo;) on
line three was replaced by the nonsensical &ldquo;De

<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">The most difficult and complex
cases of redrawing are found not on the pictorial pages but rather
in the upper portions of prose pages. As in the case of &ldquo;De
Ad&uacute;lteras,&rdquo; the lack of knowledge of Spanish
occasionally created an impediment when redrawing lines of Guaman
Poma&rsquo;s prose text. Lines three on actual pages 401 and 415,
respectively, reveal the difficulty. The macron over the letter
&ldquo;q&rdquo; to render Spanish &ldquo;que&rdquo; is replaced by
a French circumflex, and &ldquo;el moso&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;le
moso&rdquo; (Guaman Poma 1936, 399, 413; <a target="Caption"

reader&rsquo;s best guide to the minimal cursive rewritings in the

the general heaviness and &ldquo;smudged&rdquo; appearance of the
cursive letters, as well as the broad, inexplicable mark that
appears between the &ldquo;g&rdquo; and &ldquo;o&rdquo; of
&ldquo;Rodrigo,&rdquo; are the result of the nearly impossible task
of painting out the bled-through images from the opposite side of
the sheet. In this particular instance no attempt was made to write
over Guaman Poma&rsquo;s cursive script. Page 397, however, reveals
clearly that an attempt <i>was</i> made to rewrite Guaman
Poma&rsquo;s cursive text because the overlying pen strokes are
clearly not his own.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">In this context, Fraser&rsquo;s
(1996, 283) statement that much of the facsimile &ldquo;is in fact,
a copy, probably a tracing on to an overlay&rdquo; must be
rejected. The examples of variation that she noted between the
original manuscript and the Paris facsimile are not the result of
its universal recopying but rather, in quite limited circumstances,
the effort to compensate for the tiny losses to the text&rsquo;s
graphic integrity occasioned by the &ldquo;painting out&rdquo; of
images that had &ldquo;bled through&rdquo; from the back of the
sheet.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Fraser
(1996, 283) presented some examples that reveal, contrary to her
hypothesis, how</span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang=
"EN-US">exceptional the actual cases of redrawing are. One of the
instances she cited is that of the stars in the upper left hand
portion of the <i>mapamundi</i> (actual page 1001). Here redrawing
did occur in the printed facsimile in the form of little circles
that appear inside some of the stars in the drawing&rsquo;s
firmament.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Two other
examples of presumed modification result not, as Fraser claimed,
from full-scale retracing. They stem, instead, from an attempt, in
the first instance, to suppress images and text that have bled
through from the reverse of the sheet and, in the second, the
failure to do so. The first case pertains to the absence of shading
on some of the June harvest&rsquo;s potatoes pictured in the
drawing of that month (actual page 1157; Guaman Poma 1936, 1147;
<a target="Caption" onclick="clicker(this)" href="1157.htm">Figures
4a and 4b</a>). Fraser (1996, 283) asserted that the
&ldquo;copyist&rdquo; &ldquo;omitted the shading on some of the
potatoes&rdquo; while retracing the image.This is, however, a
simple case of tiny pen strokes being lost when the ink that
penetrated the verso from the recto was painted out. Further
scrutiny of the same picture reveals also that after the unwanted
ink penetrations were removed from the face of the kneeling female
figure, a technician redrew her eye (incompletely), and replaced
the original wavy line of her face-framing hair by a straight line
that looks like the border of a cap. Again, the redrawing was
occasioned by the effort to restore the pen strokes that the
paintouts had eradicated; it was not part of an overall retracing
effort.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">In the
second case, a small Greek cross, a so-called &ldquo;cross
form&eacute;e,&rdquo; appears, unmotivated, on the pictorial
background of the drawing of Saint Bartholomew (Guaman Poma
1936,</span> <span lang="EN-US" style=

283) interpreted this to be the result of the
&ldquo;copyist&rsquo;s&rdquo; &ldquo;tracing it through onto the
<i>recto</i> where it appears without explanation.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
perfect image of the cross form&eacute;e that adorns the picture
was not traced through from the opposite side of the sheet.&nbsp;
It was, rather, a case in which the technician correcting the text
failed to remove, apparently by simple oversight, the bleedthrough
from the other side of the sheet.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Finally,
there is the case of the black or mulatto figure whipping a
native</span> <span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Andean, which
Fraser discussed with regard to Guaman Poma&rsquo;s artistry
(actual page 810; Guaman Poma 1936, 796; <a target="Caption"
onclick="clicker(this)" href="810.htm">Figures 6a and
6b</a>).&nbsp;Again, the matter of bleedthrough is pertinent.
Fraser (1996, 283) asserted that the &ldquo;soft downy
growth&rdquo; that appears on the chin and upper lip of the figure
with a version of a cat-o&rsquo;-nine-tails in hand, visible in
Guaman Poma&rsquo;s original drawing, was &ldquo;an effect created,
perhaps, by [his] dampening the paper or licking the pen
nib.&rdquo; This procedure seems highly unusual amidst Guaman
Poma&rsquo;s characteristically single, clear, thin-pen strokes. In
fact, the effect was not created by introducing moisture while
composing the original. It is instead a combination of the original
drawing&rsquo;s very thinly</span> <span lang="EN-US" xml:lang=
"EN-US">drawn curls combined with a bleedthrough from the verso.
Here, the result that Fraser observed was not caused by an unusual
technique employed by Guaman Poma on this single occasion but
rather by the penetration of ink from the other side of the sheet
into the exceptionally finely wrought drawing.</span></p>

xml:lang="EN-US">Overall, by their character and limited number,
these instances reveal how faithful the Paris print facsimile was
to the manuscript that it reproduced. Generally, imperfect
renderings are caused by the inability to cover the bleedthroughs.
Many tiny (and often nearly imperceptible) distortions thus appear
not because of aggressive, post-photography manipulation of the
images but rather from the reticence to manipulate them too
much.</span></p>

China Paper Applications<br />
The second most important consideration, obvious to the
online-edition viewer, is the presence of gummed China paper strips
that have been applied to some two hundred pages of the autograph
manuscript. There are approximately thirty such applications to the
outer margins of the outside sheets at the front and back of the
codex, which no doubt became especially worn from Guaman
Poma&rsquo;s handling, moisture, etc., before the manuscript was
bound in a cover. Approximately 175 China paper applications are
found across the vulnerable upper portions of heavily inked pages,
mostly in the range of actual pages 100-600. Also affected, not
surprisingly, are several pages of &ldquo;Camina el autor,&rdquo;
which Guaman Poma wrote in Lima on loose quires that he would later
tuck into the completed manuscript (see actual pages 1105, 1106,

assertions, such as my own of two decades ago (Adorno, 1979-80, 8)

<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">The 1990s witnessed the
production of much documentary evidence that sheds new light on
Guaman Poma and his activities as they relate to the production of
the work by which we know him. El&iacute;as Prado Tello and Alfredo

possession of the lands of Chiara in the valley of Chupas,
Huamanga,</span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">gives a much
fuller and more detailed picture of the land-title struggles in
which Guaman Poma was engaged in the 1590s. Overall, we find that
Guaman Poma&rsquo;s assertions about his activities reflect the
attitudes and actions of the Andean provincial elite from the
mid-sixteenth century onward. On the whole, these individuals
responded eagerly to the chance to seek offices and privileges in
the colonial system. Starting in the 1550s, native lords served as
subordinates to Spanish colonial administrators, and they continued
to compete for positions in the Spanish colonial bureaucracy after
the reorganization of native society under the viceroy Francisco de
Toledo (1569-1581). Guaman Poma&rsquo;s documented experience
offers a vivid example of this tendency as he served in many of the
intermediary roles played by Andeans who learned
Spanish.</span></p>

Poma was in Lima at the royal Audiencia, that is, the highest civil
and criminal court of the viceroyalty, on at least two occasions in
the late 1590s.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> In
both instances, he presented documents upholding his and his
clansmen&rsquo;s claims to the Chupas lands. His first appearance
is documented as 11 September 1597, when the royal notary Juan

It now seems likely that Guaman Poma began writing his work no
earlier than after the end of the year 1600, not as early as 1585,
as I had argued earlier <span style=

lost his legal battles to land claims in the area of Huamanga and
after he was exiled from that city on 19 December 1600.
Acknowledging these hardships only allusively in the <i>Nueva
cor&oacute;nica y buen gobierno</i>, Guaman Poma nevertheless let
slip the observation, in discussing the pretensions and criminal
activities of &ldquo;common Indians,&rdquo; that he first became
aware of such social disintegration&mdash;Andean society being
turned &ldquo;upside-down&rdquo;&mdash;when he began his travels,
that is, as he wrote, &ldquo;in the year that we left, of 16[0]0

having spent &ldquo;twenty if not thirty&rdquo; years writing his

plausible. Without his Huamanga-based employment in occupations
such as church inspector&rsquo;s assistant or minor functionary and
witness in land-transfer transactions, he probably devoted
considerable time, over a period of ten or more years, to the
research and composition of his book. I summarize the pertinent

Philip III on 14 February 1615 that he had completed his work
(Guaman Poma in Adorno 2001, 86), we know that he did not put the
final, finishing touches on it earlier than the first months of
1616. The signally important datum on this point is a note that he
appended to his completed portrait of the eleventh viceroy, Don
Juan de Mendoza y Luna (actual page 474; <a target="Caption"

that Guaman Poma&rsquo;s writing task carried him beyond December

Montesclaros left office on 18 December 1615. Although it is

assessment of his final editing of the work.<span style=

Guaman Poma&rsquo;s planning and execution of his book, quire by
quire, is quite remarkable. The regularity of the first twenty
quires, all &ldquo;large,&rdquo; reveals that he copied out his
work onto the pages of the prepared quires in a pattern and
arrangement well designed before their execution. As indicated
above (Section 1.1.1), twice-folded sheets, each yielding four
quarto sheets or eight pages, were used to make up most of the
quires. <span lang="EN-US" style=

6 &ldquo;pliegos&rdquo; (6 x 8 = 48 pages), which probably
represents the model of construction that Guaman Poma originally
intended for the entire work. The composition of the final quires,
in the form of single sheets with flaps pasted together to make
composite double sheets, suggests the scarcity of writing
materials&mdash;perhaps, in fact, Guaman Poma&rsquo;s dwindling

been to fully coordinate quires and chapters, ending a chapter at
the end of a quire. However, he soon must have realized the
difficulty of doing so, and he obviously became comfortable
ignoring the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; breaks provided by the
beginnings and endings of quires as he continued the redaction of
this final copy of the work. Guaman Poma concluded a chapter on the
verso of the last sheet of a quire only three times, without
counting the belatedly added &ldquo;Camina el autor.&rdquo; These
are chapters 4, 33, and 35, which are concluded at the end of
quires 1, 20, and 21, respectively (see Table 2, below).</span></p>

xml:lang="EN-US">The confidence with which Guaman Poma proceeded
through the making of the book is apparent, again suggesting that
he worked from a draft that allowed him to realize the final copy
with a minimum of misslips. Table 2 summarizes the contents of the
work and its distribution over the prepared quires by coordinating
the online edition&rsquo;s table of contents with quire and page
numbers.</span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">&nbsp;</span>

</b><br />
Guaman Poma&rsquo;s method of textual composition in this final
version of his<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">manuscript was to
work page by page and from top to bottom in a single process.&nbsp;
(Pagination, catchwords, and marginal emendations were added
later.) For the pictures, he always drew the frame-lines first,
starting either with the running head or with the first line of the
drawing&rsquo;s title. This top line of text served as the top line
of the frame; vertical and horizontal lines created the other three
picture boundaries. In this procedure the title of the drawing was
always created prior to the pictorial elements. When a picture
title appeared beneath a running head, the running head was
probably created first, as is the case for the prose pages. The
procedure for these accompanying prose pages was less complex, but
it followed the same top-to-bottom execution.&nbsp;This procedure
is revealed by the accommodation of letters of the picture
title</span> <span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">to the running
head above it; quick examples are the short &ldquo;l,&rdquo; the
small &ldquo;o,&rdquo; the left-bent &ldquo;h,&rdquo; and the short
&ldquo;d&rdquo; and &ldquo;h&rdquo; in the picture titles on actual
pages 844, 874, 877, and 880, respectively. The running head
uniformly constituted the top line of the text frame; occasionally,
a large, calligraphic line of text was created beneath it.
Afterward the text</span> <span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">in
script was written out, always within the boundaries of an
invisible frame that give Guaman Poma&rsquo;s pages of text
remarkably uniform margins.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">The
relationship of pictorial to prose text is always defined by the
priority of the drawing over the page or pages of its verbal
accompaniment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>
Variations in the color of ink occasionally make this relational
aspect evident, but the discernment of this compositional procedure
is not dependent on the visual perception of differences in ink
color. Each and every one of Guaman Poma&rsquo;s 398 drawings,
whether they appear on recto or verso pages, initiate a
presentation that is only subsequently supplemented by being
&ldquo;put into words&rdquo; in a page or more of prose. Two vivid
examples are actual pages 636-637 and 708-709. In the first
instance, Guaman Poma depicts a native assistant (<i>fiscal</i>)
with the new parish priest, the former offering to the latter the
writing tools that he has gathered up at the priest&rsquo;s
command. The priest replies that he is not interested in serving a
community in which the means to expose his anticipated actions are
so readily available; he tells the <i>fiscal,</i> &ldquo;Tomorrow
I&rsquo;ll be on my way!&rdquo; Although Guaman Poma writes the
anecdote briefly into the picture, it is on the following page of
prose that he spells it out more fully, indicating where it
occurred, and commenting at length on the incident.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=
"mso-layout-grid-align:none;punctuation-wrap:simple; text-autospace:none">

xml:lang="EN-US">The other vivid example that I would mention that
reveals how the prose text is conceived to support the primary
visual text is found in the famous depiction of the
&ldquo;tariff&rdquo; (<i>&ldquo;aranzel&rdquo;</i>) exacted from
the Andean population by the Spanish colonial administration. Here
Guaman Poma allegorizes the various officers of colonial government
as real and mythical animal predators of the colonized Andeans.
Identifying each beast with a colonial official in the picture, he
elaborates these allegorical correspondences in the written account
that follows (actual pages 708-709).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=
"mso-layout-grid-align:none;punctuation-wrap:simple; text-autospace:none">
<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">If the reader peruses each of
the 398 drawings and reads the accompanying prose texts, it will be
apparent that this &ldquo;first-picture-then-prose&rdquo; method
was, for Guaman Poma, not only his compositional procedure but the
very heart of his conceptualization of his work. The pictures
announce, dramatize, and &ldquo;presentify&rdquo; the book&rsquo;s
contents; they are the work&rsquo;s primary text, not its secondary
&ldquo;illustrations.&rdquo; He designed, in fact, the majority of
his chapters as alternating pages of pictures and prose. There are,
meanwhile, significant differences in the quantity of material in
the prose texts; some pages have generous spaces between lines of
writing while others are tightly cramped. The reader who observes
these differences will appreciate the fact that Guaman Poma&rsquo;s
pictures dictate the course and content of his exposition and that
the alternating spaces he allotted for their prose complements
restricted in length the verbal content to be communicated. He
simply had to &ldquo;make do&rdquo; with the space available as he
had allotted it, whether the supplementary prose text was long or
short.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=
"mso-layout-grid-align:none;punctuation-wrap:simple; text-autospace:none">
<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Excellent examples of how the
pictures structure the work, and how the prose texts were adjusted
to the space he made available to them, appear in the crucial
chapter, &ldquo;Buen gobierno&rdquo; (chapter 20). There Guaman
Poma barely found sufficient space available between pictures to
set forth his written account of the viceroy Francisco de
Toledo&rsquo;s administration that included Toledo&rsquo;s
execution of the Inka prince Tupac Amaru as well as his own related
recommendations on native governance (actual pages 447-459).
Another example is the contrast between his treatment of the
then-distant second viceroy of Peru, Don Antonio de Mendoza
(1551-1552) and that of the contemporary eleventh viceroy&mdash;the
last one to rule during the writing of his book&mdash;Don Juan de
Mendoza y Luna, the marquis of Montesclaros. Guaman Poma's lack of
information about, or interest in, the long-gone regime of Antonio
de Mendoza left him with so much extra space on the single prose
page devoted to that administration that he had room enough, at the
end, to introduce one of his famous harangues against</span>
<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">&ldquo;foolish and incapable
and pusillanimous Spaniards.&rdquo; In contrast, given his
firsthand knowledge of Montesclaros' government, Guaman Poma faced
a real challenge in squeezing into a single page of prose all that
he had to say about that viceroy's governance (actual pages 439,
475; see Section 4.3.2, below).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=
"mso-layout-grid-align:none;punctuation-wrap:simple; text-autospace:none">
<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">There are only a few exceptions
to this dual-medium compositional rule. Chapters that are
exclusively or nearly exclusively prose texts consist of dialogues,
preacherly harangues, commentary on previous chronicles, and the
author&rsquo;s narration of his trip to Lima (chapters 26, 27, 31,
32, 34, and 36).</span></p>

xml:lang="EN-US">Apart from these general procedures, we find brief
captions added beneath the picture box of many drawings. The
distinctive ink color of these captions contrasts with other ink
colors on the respective pages, suggesting that they were
introduced at a point in time later than that of the creation of
the pictures; actual pages 145, 196 and 198 provide quick examples
of these contrasts. These picture captions seem to have left no ink
blots and were no doubt entered prior to the sewing of the
manuscript when Guaman Poma could spread out the double sheets,
enter the captions, and let the ink dry before uniting the quire
again.</span>

cor&oacute;nica&rdquo;<br />
The preparation of the &ldquo;Tabla&rdquo; constitutes the next
distinctive phase in the construction of Guaman Poma&rsquo;s work.
It begins and ends on the sheets of the final two quires of the
manuscript, starting on the verso page of quire 25 and occupying
all of quire 26 (actual pages 1178-1187).<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> Both of these quires are made up
of composite double sheets, that is, two single sheets with flap,
pasted together, thus giving evidence of Guaman Poma&rsquo;s
struggle in managing diminishing resources. (The pasted-on single
sheet that follows it, featuring the presentation statement and the
coat of arms of Castille [actual pages 1188-1189], was probably
added after the completion of the full manuscript at a much later
point in time.)</a></b></span></p>

xml:lang="EN-US">Guaman Poma obviously considered the
&ldquo;Tabla&rdquo; to be an important work of design and
calligraphy. Because of the formal qualities that he created and
endeavored to maintain there, the &ldquo;Tabla&rdquo; is ultimately
a multiple and less accurate &ldquo;witness&rdquo; to the actual
contents of the work than it is to the aims that the author/artist
had for its creation. It provides eloquent testimony to the
aspirations that Guaman Poma had for this version of his work as
the presentation copy destined for Philip III. More interestingly,
it reveals the multiple and complex ways in which Guaman Poma
conceptualized and organized his work. I explore here only the most
basic aspects of his creative handling of the convention of the
table of contents, reserving for another occasion a full analysis.
At present, my main interest is to show how his &ldquo;Tabla&rdquo;
conceptualization of the &ldquo;good government&rdquo; relates to
his finally emergent view of the rule of the viceroys, in
particular, the Marqu&eacute;s de Montesclaros. The key to the
&ldquo;Tabla&rdquo; conceptualization of &ldquo;good
government&rdquo; can be approached by considering the levels of
organization that Guaman Poma conceived for his
work.</span><b><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang=

also suggested by Guaman Poma&rsquo;s calligraphy as it appears in
the &ldquo;Tabla&rdquo;. He created, in large Latinate lower case
letters, ten graphically distinctive segments that constitute yet
another form of logical organization across the work&rsquo;s three
main divisions. These calligraphically-defined units and the
chapters they include are: (1) the creation or &ldquo;first
age&rdquo; of the world (chapters 1-3); (2) the history of the
Roman Catholic papacy (chapter 4); (3) the origins or &ldquo;first
age&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Indians that God brought to this New

Indians of the world, that is, the history of the Inkas (chapters
6-18); (5) &ldquo;CONquista,&rdquo; or the conquest of Peru by the
Spanish that includes the listing of the viceroys and the other
entities of the &ldquo;buen gobierno&rdquo; (chapters 19-20); (6)
the &ldquo;history&rdquo; of the various Spanish social groups in
the viceroyalty, arranged in hierarchical order (chapters 21-27,

categories, also defined according to criteria of hierarchy and

moral &ldquo;Considerations,&rdquo; his evocation of ten,
past-to-present ages of the Andean world. This last text begins
with the ancient &ldquo;first age&rdquo; of the Indians and

the work that appears under that title or to its important
inaugural chapter (chapter 20). The viceroys and other civil and
ecclesiastical officers that appear in the &ldquo;Buen
gobierno&rdquo; chapter are placed under the heading
&ldquo;CONquista,&rdquo; which is the fifth main entry of the ten
that appear in the &ldquo;Tabla.&rdquo; In this context, Guaman
Poma presents the civil and ecclesiastical leadership of viceregal
Peru simply as the continuation of the succession of conquerors and
(legal and illegal) governors that began with Francisco Pizarro and
Diego de Almagro. This is a strikingly subdued presentation, at
best, of the offices of &ldquo;good government.&rdquo; Before the
manuscript left his hands, however, Guaman Poma would reconsider
the interpretation of viceregal governance implied by the
&ldquo;Tabla.&rdquo; He would dramatically amend chapter 20 so as
to represent by its means the most exemplary values of moral
political authority (see Sections 4.3, 4.5, below).</span></p>

Poma&rsquo;s near-final task in creating the text of the body of

between quires, with verso-page ink blots caused by recto-page
catchwords (see actual pages 901 and 902 at the meeting point of
quires 17 and 18 for an example). Hence, it is clear that the entry
of the catchwords also occurred after the manuscript was sewn. It
is likely that Guaman Poma entered the catchwords and the page
numbers in two successive, systematic operations and that they
constituted the last steps in the full (at the time, final, but in

block, reveals that this was the final and separate step in the
preparation of the &ldquo;Tabla&rdquo;(Section 2.4). All the page

As Guaman Poma was completing his book by entering the page numbers
into the &ldquo;Tabla,&rdquo; he likely discovered that he had
repeated a sequence of ten numbers, and he subsequently attempted
to rectify the error at another location, beginning the correction
at his page 986, which he modified to 996. As a result of this
repagination, I questioned whether previously there had been a
short chapter tucked in between the pages of the manuscript that
Guaman Poma numbered 985 and 996 (actual pages 1003 and 1004). Yet
there appeared &ldquo;no evidence of pages having been added or
removed from this place in the manuscript&rdquo; (Adorno 1979-80,
18). The Royal Library&rsquo;s recent codicological survey confirms
my earlier assessment: there is no evidence to suggest a one-time
insertion or deletion of a unit of five additional sheets, the
equivalent of ten pages, at this or any other point. (Only one
sheet has been excised; see Sections 4.1 and 4.3, below.)

presentation of the cities and towns, the past chronicles, the inns

Poma made another adjustment. He changed the catchword on his page
985 from &ldquo;todas&rdquo; (in reference to &ldquo;todas las

&ldquo;cap&iacute;tulo,&rdquo; which refers to
&ldquo;cap&iacute;tulo primero de las ciudades y villas,&rdquo;
which is found on page 987-cum-997. While the cancelled catchword
on page 985, &ldquo;todas,&rdquo; was the formal marker denoting,
in conventional fashion, the content of page 986, its replacement
by &ldquo;cap&iacute;tulo,&rdquo; referring to page 987, must have
been considered by Guaman Poma to be a logical marker, signifying
that the chapter of cities and towns began on that page. His
&ldquo;Tabla&rdquo; entry for the chapter confirms it: he wrote
&ldquo;987,&rdquo; not &ldquo;986,&rdquo; to indicate the page on
which the chapter of cities and towns was to begin. Thus he
considered the prose presentation of page 986 to be a preliminary
announcement; for him, the chapter proper began on the following

the repetition of page numbers 154-155 (actual pages 154-157) might
not have attracted his notice because the repetition occurs in the

while entering the page number for his &ldquo;historia de los

corpulence and laziness of these subjects. The chapter begins on
his page 534 (actual page 548) with a picture of a Spanish couple,
grotesquely exaggerated in size and bulk, and he entered the number
534 into the &ldquo;Tabla.&rdquo;<span style=

series of page numbers he now discovered near that point
corresponded to: (1) his accounts of civil administrators
(<i>corregidores&rsquo;</i> lieutenants, provincial judges, and
notaries), miners, and mining administrators (actual pages
527-536), and (2) miners, majordomos, and wayfaring Spaniards,
taking this last account through its antepenultimate page (actual
pages 537-546). (These various units appear under the general title

was consistent with Guaman Poma&rsquo;s comparable, later effort to
renumber the final thirty-nine pages of the body of his manuscript
(the chapter of the months of the year and the one-page admonition
to the Christian reader [actual pages 1140-1178]), after he had
inserted in front of them the &ldquo;Camina el autor&rdquo; chapter
(actual pages 1104-1139). In the case of the repeated sequence
523-532, however, Guaman Poma&rsquo;s problem would be to determine
just where best to make the ten-page correction. It would be a
herculean task to begin at the second of the pages numbered 523
(actual page 537), because this would require renumbering
approximately half the pages of the manuscript book. It would be
better to do it somewhat late in the work, but by what
criteria?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> Here we must
ask what pages or sections of his manuscript he especially would
have wanted to avoid marring with clumsy renumbering. Since this
was to be the presentation copy of his work destined for the king,
we can guess that he would want his important
&ldquo;dialogue&rdquo; with the monarch (chapter 32) to retain its
graphic integrity. The same can be said, even more emphatically,
for his desire to keep intact his exquisite, elaborate
<i>mapamundi.</i></span></p>

page which follows the <i>mapamundi</i> and closes the discussion
of it (Guaman Poma&rsquo;s page 985, actual page 1003), precisely
to his page 986 (actual page 1004), which announces the following
page&rsquo;s commencement of the chapter on the cities and towns.
Given the undesirablity of any previous sites for the purpose, his
page 986 provided a plausible starting-point for the ten-page
correction. It follows the texts that he presumably wished to
retain as pristinely as possible, and it begins the series of only
four chapters that, at that point in time, concluded the book
(&ldquo;cities and towns;&rdquo; &ldquo;past chronicles,&rdquo;
&ldquo;inns, or <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">tanpu</i>,

xml:lang="EN-US">On 15 February 1615, Guaman Poma wrote a letter to
king Philip III from Santiago de Chipao, in the southern Peruvian
province of Lucanas where he most likely spent his years of exile,
announcing that he had completed a book that he wished to dispatch
to the monarch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>
Somewhat arbitrarily, we may consider this date to mark the
&ldquo;completion&rdquo; of the work. The date is arbitrary insofar
as it may not coincide with Guaman Poma&rsquo;s actual assessment
that his work was completed. Additionally, he may have already
started making emendations to his text by that date. Apart from his
repagination of 124 pages at the end of his book, he may well have
effected some of his other revisions prior to leaving Lucanas for
Lima during the autumn (February or March) of 1615. Most of his
emendations can be identified only as being subsequent to his
sewing and pagination of the manuscript, without regard to whether
they were made in provincial Lucanas or in Lima, where new
information might have become available to him. Other
modifications, such as most of the extensive revisions he made to
chapter 20, are clearly attributable to the period subsequent to
his arrival to Lima, from sometime in the first half of 1615
through at least the early months of 1616. Of all these changes,
the most intriguing one, and the one least possible to identify
with regard to the site of its execution, is the portrait of the
viceroy Montesclaros, to be considered below.</span></p>

final phases of Guaman Poma&rsquo;s work are of great interest
because they reveal his preoccupations as an author and artist as
he drew his project to a close in 1615 and 1616. What were his
final pursuits?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> What
new or renewed aims emerged as time, resources, energy, and
opportunity ran out?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>
This is a question that might be put to any author, but in Guaman
Poma&rsquo;s circumstances as a Spanish-speaking Andean and a
self-proclaimed &ldquo;author and prince&rdquo; in early colonial
Peru, it takes on particular urgency. The question and its answers
fully reveal the individuality of Guaman Poma&rsquo;s authorship
and the single-minded integrity of the work that he
produced.&nbsp;</span></p>

xml:lang="EN-US">On the issue of late revisions, the Royal
Library&rsquo;s codicological survey has allowed me to extend
substantially my earlier conclusions about Guaman Poma&rsquo;s
emendation of this final, presentation copy of his autograph
manuscript. In particular, the new information underscores the
consistency and coherence with which Guaman Poma carried out the
task of preparing this final copy. His meticulousness reveals his
continual effort to produce a work that was internally coherent and
complete, correcting earlier oversights or mistakes. At the same
time, he made other judgments based on artistic criteria. In this
regard, his thinking was as nuanced as that of any modern author
and artist taking into consideration the demands of content and the
prerogatives of design while managing each situation on its merits
in light of complex criteria that sometimes conflicted with one
another. The most impressive demonstration of his management of
diverse, sometimes conflicting objectives is his repeated
emendation of chapter 20 (actual pages 438-490), &ldquo;on good
government.&rdquo;</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">I reconstruct below Guaman
Poma&rsquo;s progress through the final phases of his work&rsquo;s
preparation as he coped with diminishing resources and balanced his
two highest priorities as author and scribe: first, to honor the
requirements of content, providing important new information as he
concluded his work, and, second, to satisfy the demands of
esthetics by creating a homogeneous, harmonious manuscript book
worthy of presentation to Philip III.</span></p>

xml:lang="EN-US">Overall, the need to balance the criteria of
textual content and graphic beauty explains many of the apparent
contradictions in the later phases of Guaman Poma&rsquo;s execution
of his work. I have long thought that his particular kinds of
emendation to the final manuscript (marginal notations, added
sheets, etc.) could be explained on the basis of an increasing
shortage of writing materials. Today we know that there are a
number of small quires fabricated out of single sheets (Section
1.1., above). And now we also know that there is only one example
in the whole book (after it was bound) of deletion and
rewriting&mdash;the successive Montesclaros portraits, to be
considered below (Section 4.1)&mdash;which shows that Guaman Poma
would allow himself to use fresh paper only if the issue were of
the greatest importance to him.</span></p>

xml:lang="EN-US">The threat of a dwindling paper supply placed
severe limitations on his freedom to choose among a range of
options while reviewing his manuscript. It had a considerable
impact on how, when faced with a wish to update it, he was forced
to weigh the competing priorities of economy (Could the new message
be limited to a correction to an existing page?), content (Could
the new message be communicated fully, and how could the
possibilities of misunderstanding be reduced?), and esthetics
(Could the correction be made less obtrusive by grafting the new
message onto the old one?).</span></p>

Poma&rsquo;s Additions to the Completed Manuscript<br />
After completing the composition of his work, its emendation was an
equally complex process, and there are several kinds of evidence
for it: (1) significant variations in ink color; (2) overwritten
decorative lines and flourishes that appear, colophon-like, in the
lower portion of many prose pages; and (3) the cramped handwriting
style that appears at the lower margin of many pages because the
heel of Guaman Poma&rsquo;s writing hand had to rest inches below

accounts of the viceroys of Peru in the &ldquo;buen gobierno&rdquo;

Poma&rsquo;s lower-margin annotations spelling out the years of
rule of each of the viceroys, we find that the difference in the
color of ink from the main body of the text, together with the less
fluid handwriting style, reveals the practice. See also Sections

it bears the same watermark (Latin Cross over AI; see Section 1.2,
above) as does the &ldquo;Camina el autor&rdquo; chapter, which was
also written after Guaman Poma arrived in Lima (see Section 4.2,
below). This inserted sheet is an account of<span style=

both pages of the Montesclaros replacement entry mentioned above,
where Guaman Poma had initially identified Montesclaros as the
ninth viceroy, he now struck out &ldquo;ninth&rdquo; and wrote
beneath it &ldquo;tenth.&rdquo; Guaman Poma did not repeat this
plus-one adjustment in the already completed &ldquo;Tabla&rdquo;

the absence of pagination and catchword suggests the attachment or

only conclude that Guaman Poma himself tucked (but did not paste)

of Quires 22 and 23, &ldquo;Camina el autor&rdquo;<br />
The most noteworthy late addition to the completed manuscript,
&ldquo;Camina el autor,&rdquo; details Guaman Poma&rsquo;s final
journey to deliver his completed manuscript to the viceregal court.
Twenty years ago, I judged this chapter to be a late addition to
the manuscript on the basis of its textual references to events
that occurred subsequent to Guaman Poma&rsquo;s arrival in Lima,
its absence from Guaman Poma&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tabla de la dicha
cor&oacute;nica,&rdquo; and the fact that Guaman Poma had
renumbered the pages of<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> the following chapter on the
months of the year (Adorno 1979-80, 27, note 13). Today, the new
codicological evidence completes the analysis: &ldquo;Camina el
autor&rdquo; (chapter 36) is the exclusive occupant of two quires,
numbered 22 and 23 (actual pages 1104-1131 and 1132-1139,
respectively), and they and the single-sheet Torres y Portugal
insertion bear a common watermark that is not found anywhere else
in the manuscript (see Section 1.2,
above).&nbsp;</a></span></b></p>

<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">If in Lima Guaman Poma revised
his &ldquo;Buen gobierno&rdquo; chapter by adding the Torres y
Portugal entry, in Lima, too, he wrote &ldquo;Camina el
autor,&rdquo; which he concluded with an account of how in that
city he secured a house and paid twenty <i>reales</i> a month in
rent as a &ldquo;poor man, and for other poor people whom he
carried with him, out of the love of God&rdquo; (&ldquo;Y en la
dicha ciudad alquil&oacute; una casa y le pag&oacute; por cada mes
ueynte rreales como pobre y para otros pobres que trayya concigo
por amor de Dios&rdquo;; actual page 1136). This autobiographical
account was a freestanding unit, a chapter made up of two quires
unattached to the manuscript. He prepared no chapter more carefully
than this most vulnerable one. Its vulnerablity centered on: (1)
the impossibility of introducing it into the completed
&ldquo;Tabla;&rdquo; (2) its reliance on an already-used number
sequence, &ldquo;1094-1129,&rdquo; which previously corresponded to
the chapter of the months of the year that was now to follow it;
and (3) the precariousness of its insertion before the final
chapter of a &ldquo;closed&rdquo; manuscript.</span></p>

loss of this very important account of the revelations of his
journey to Lima, Guaman Poma sought a solution for securing it
beyond his usual means of pagination and a catchword at the foot of
every page. He wrote out, over the upper margins of all its pages,
a continuous narrative running head that summarized not only the
content of the chapter but also the position as advocate and
witness that he took throughout the entire work. His use of this
additional device was not original to him, but it stands as the
unique instance in his work:</span></p>

provide the reader with a means of keeping the two quires of this
chapter in proper sequential order (it did not succeed, as we saw
above, Section 2.3), it could not guarantee its proper, permanent

provided an internal means capable of ordering the chapter within
itself and identifying it as part of a chronicle authored by Guaman
Poma, but it could not describe its own placement within the larger
work.&nbsp;</span></p>

narrative device?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>
Although there was no space to insert the mention of this new
chapter in his &ldquo;Tabla,&rdquo; Guaman Poma most likely created
this elaborate running head so that it could be introduced into the
printed version of the &ldquo;Tabla&rdquo; if his book were
published. Since it was composed of complete utterances, it had a
syntactic elasticity that lent it to use, in whole or in part, as
an entry in a projected print version of the &ldquo;Tabla de la

the presence of highwaymen, rogues, and vagabonds at every

xml:lang="EN-US">The close reading of &ldquo;Camina el autor&rdquo;
alongside dozens of his bottom-marginal annotations, particularly

in further, insistent emendations throughout his work (see Table 3,
above).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> Philological
and textual evidence supports my assertion.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> The &ldquo;q&rdquo; that replaces

&ldquo;qura&rdquo; (actual pages 525, 1115; 725, 1107).<span style=

xml:lang="EN-US">The simultaneous, late creation of this
narrational chapter and the marginal notations is also confirmed by
thematic correspondences. He now recommends, for example, that the
Jesuits, who had been so much the object of his praise, should
remove themselves from lay society and live secluded from the world
(actual pages 483, 1122).<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> His late emendation about the
pestilence in the cities is obviously another post-Lima entry, as
are: his warnings that Andeans should not be allowed to become
beggars in the cities, &ldquo;for they will become
drunkards;&rdquo; his admonition that Andeans should wear their own
traditional garb, not European clothes; and his citation of the
viceroy Toledo&rsquo;s ordinances prohibiting Spaniards from living
in Andean communities (actual pages 1083-1084; 857, 1138; 553,
1125; 921, 1125-1126). Guaman Poma&rsquo;s &ldquo;Camina el
autor&rdquo; was a major though late contribution to his work, and
the fact that its new revelations prompted reiterations of many of
its central points as marginal notations underscores the importance
with which he imbued it.</span></p>

xml:lang="EN-US">One might suppose that Guaman Poma would have
desired to present as the final chapter of his book this narrated
journey and its devastating overview of the evils of colonialism in
city and countryside. Such was not the case. On material grounds,
it was impossible to make &ldquo;Camina el autor&rdquo; the
concluding chapter because the &ldquo;Tabla de la dicha
cor&oacute;nica,&rdquo; which would have followed it, begins in the
middle of a quire and on a verso page, leaving no space in which to
make a stitched insertion. He was able, instead, to place the two
quires of &ldquo;Camina el autor&rdquo; after quire 21 (at the end
of chapter 35), which conveniently ends on a verso page.</span></p>

&ldquo;Camina el autor&rdquo; as the penultimate chapter of the
book suited Guaman Poma. The preceding chapter 35, listing the inns
on the royal road, provided an appropriate context for the precise
itinerary Guaman Poma followed from the Andean highlands to the
coast as well as his remarks pertaining to shorter travels that
preceded it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>
Additionally, &ldquo;Camina el autor&rdquo; ends with a series of
minor observations and recommendations; Guaman Poma clearly did not
intend it to be a new conclusion to his work. For that purpose, he
had already created his finale presentation, &ldquo;Ojos i

When Guaman Poma prepared his &ldquo;Tabla de la dicha
cor&oacute;nica&rdquo; (see actual pages 1184 and 1185), he set out
the contents but not the title of chapter 20, &ldquo;of good
government.&rdquo; As we saw earlier in Section 3.5, his entries
consisted of the viceroys in succession as a continuation of the
list of Spanish conquerors and early (official and unofficial)
rulers of Peru, all listed under the heading
&ldquo;CONquista,&rdquo; the fifth segment in his ten-part division
of the work presented in the &ldquo;Tabla&rdquo; (See Figure 9b).
We discover through his emendation of the work, notably the
replacement Montesclaros text, that Guaman Poma modified the
implicitly negative connotations about viceregal rule conveyed in
the &ldquo;Tabla&rdquo; in order to foreground and elevate the role
of the viceroys.</a></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=
"mso-layout-grid-align:none;punctuation-wrap:simple; text-autospace:none">
<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">As the
&ldquo;Tabla&rdquo;entries indicate, chapter 20 consists of the
civil and ecclesiatical hierarchies of Spanish colonial governance.
First appears the civil hierarchy, that is, an incomplete but
comprehensive series of the viceroys from the first, Blasco
N&uacute;&ntilde;ez Vela (1544-1546), through the eleventh, the
marqu&eacute;s de Montesclaros (1607-1615). Guaman Poma followed
this presentation of the viceroys with that of the ecclesiastical
hierarchy of archbishops and bishops, the officers of the
Inquisition, the heads of religious orders, and the institution of
religious hermitage. He concluded the chapter by returning to the
topic of civil governance, drawing a picture of the conciliar
offices of the royal Audiencia, that is, the &ldquo;president,
judges, royal council of His Majesty of this kingdom.&rdquo; He
followed it with a prose text that lamented the current state of
affairs of governance and ended the chapter with an unusually brief
&ldquo;prologue&rdquo; to the pope and the king (actual pages
488-490). All told, the contents of this chapter are paradoxical.
He recounts presumably exemplary conduct on the part of most
viceregal officials and then ends the chapter with a scathing
account of the injustices suffered by Andeans and a direct
injunction to the pope and the king about their responsibility to
remedy them.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=

<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">In this disparity between ideal
colonial governance and actual colonial practice that Guaman Poma
sets up, the role of the viceroy&mdash;we discover&mdash;is key.
The viceroy must implement crown policies; the king can save Peru
only through the appointment of worthy and hard-working individuals
to that office, and the holders of that office must inform
themselves of the state of affairs in their jurisdictions (as
evidenced by Guaman Poma&rsquo;s emphatic approval of viceregal
inspection tours of the territories governed). The viceroy must
seek and administer justice with complete integrity. Guaman
Poma&rsquo;s portrayal of viceroys is completely serious; they are
never the object of his satire, even if they become the object of
his sharp criticism for specific deeds. Despite our common tendency
to emphasize Guaman Poma&rsquo;s literary engagement with the
institution of the monarchy, his conceptual focus is riveted on the
role of the viceroy.</span> <span lang="EN-US" style=
"mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt" xml:lang="EN-US">We observe this in the
fact that</span> <span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Guaman
Poma&rsquo;s discussion of viceregal governance is more specific
than generic, despite the fact that it is incomplete.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=
"mso-layout-grid-align:none;punctuation-wrap:simple; text-autospace:none">
<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">It is true that in his
cavalcade of viceroys Guaman Poma missed altogether the decade of
the 1560s, failing to present the tenure of the fourth viceroy,
Diego L&oacute;pez de Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga y Velasco, the count of
Nieva (1561-1564), as well as the term in office of the
<i>licenciado</i> Lope Garc&iacute;a de Castro (1564-1569), who
ruled as &ldquo;governor, captain general, and president of the
royal Audiencia&rdquo; after the assassination of the count of
Nieva in February, 1564 (Adorno 1980, xlii). Despite his
unfamiliarity with this early period of viceregal governance,
Guaman Poma nevertheless demonstrated specific and even
considerable knowledge of later viceroys who had been, in one way
or another, closer to his personal experience. It is useful to set
forth these instances, insofar as they reveal Guaman Poma&rsquo;s
intentions to &ldquo;get matters right,&rdquo; particularly in
regard to the presentation of the last viceroy to rule during the
writing of his book. His dogged persistence also reveals his desire
to emphasize the importance of the personages of royal civil
governance in general.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=
"mso-layout-grid-align:none;punctuation-wrap:simple; text-autospace:none">
<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Guaman Poma&rsquo;s most vivid
recollections are of the viceroys Francisco de Toledo (1569-1581)
and Luis de Velasco (1596-1604). He lauded Toledo for the general
inspection tour of the viceroyalty that Toledo made at the
beginning of his tenure. He described events of the viceroy&rsquo;s
journey from Lima to Cuzco in late 1570, including his visit to
Huamanga, of which Guaman Poma seems to have been a personal
observer. He praised Toledo for his legislation prohibiting
Spaniards from living among the Andeans and other laws for setting
limits on tribute payment. Two other historical episodes of
Toledo&rsquo;s rule brought Guaman Poma&rsquo;s disapproval and
condemnation. The first of these is found in his repeated, critical
references to Toledo&rsquo;s resettlement program, or <i style=
"mso-bidi-font-style:normal">reducciones,</i> instituted to bring
highland Andean communities closer to the areas where indigenous
labor was needed (colonial cities, silver and mercury mines). The
second is Toledo&rsquo;s capture and execution of the last
surviving Inka prince, Tupac Amaru (actual pages 446-454;
<a target="Caption" onclick="clicker(this)" href="453.htm">Figure
13</a>). (For Guaman Poma&rsquo;s treatment of these events, see

xml:lang="EN-US">Luis de Velasco is even more vividly recalled by
Guaman Poma. He portrayed Velasco with the unusual feature of
wearing eyeglasses, and he described some of his specific actions,
such as his naval defense of Chile against the English (actual
pages 470-471; <a target="Caption" onclick="clicker(this)" href=
"470.htm">Figure 14</a>). Additionally, in his February 1615 letter
to the king, Guaman Poma identified Velasco, the marquis of
Salinas, as the former viceroy of Peru and current president of the
Council of the Indies in Madrid, who would be able to vouch for
him: &ldquo;He has notice of my person from the time that he
governed this kingdom&rdquo; (&ldquo;La [entera noticia] tiene de
mi persona del tiempo que gobern&oacute; este reino&rdquo;) (Guaman
Poma in Adorno 2001, 86).</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=
"mso-layout-grid-align:none;punctuation-wrap:simple; text-autospace:none">
<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Since Velasco ruled from 1596
to 1604, it is likely that Guaman Poma came before him during the
period of his litigation before the high civil court (the royal
Audiencia) in Lima, on either or both of his 1597 and 1599 visits
to appear before that body (Prado Tello and Prado Prado, eds. 1991,
375, 360, 369).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> Porras
Barrenechea (1948, 33) had earlier surmised that Guaman Poma was in
the capital around 1600 or 1601 because of his claim of having
informed Velasco about the need of the <i>corregidores</i> to heed
the petitions and complaints filed by Andeans. Guaman Poma stated
that the viceroy responded by placing a fine of one hundred pesos
on offenders (actual page 832); Velasco&rsquo;s ordinances of 31
July 1601 concerning <i>corregidores</i> had established just such
a penalty.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=
"mso-layout-grid-align:none;punctuation-wrap:simple; text-autospace:none">
<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">A counterpoint to these vivid
recollections is found in Guaman Poma&rsquo;s early silence on
Fernando de Torres y Portugal, the seventh viceroy, who in 1586 had
granted the lands of Chupas in Huamanga to the Chachapoyas ethnic
group against whom Guaman Poma&rsquo;s family and the Tingo clan
brought suit. When Guaman Poma started to participate in the
litigation in the 1590s, he may have learned that Torres y Portugal
had made the Chachapoyas grant (Adorno 1993, 68).<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> Yet if the initial absence of
Torres y Portugal&rsquo;s governance from Guaman Poma&rsquo;s work
potentially could be explained on that basis, his eventual,
laudatory portrait and account of him cannot.<span style=

the best explanation.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Guaman Poma&rsquo;s precise

were responsible for the treatment of Andean laborers and
conditions in the mines (actual pages 529-539; <a target="Caption"

No one, save Montesclaros, is cast in this presentified,
future-oriented role. I believe that this important
conceptualization, unique among the depictions of all other
exemplary Andean or European personages in the work, was the cause
for Guaman Poma to reconsider and recast his account of the
eleventh viceroy whose term of office, ironically, he did see come
to an end. Although Guaman Poma would not be the first author in
history to fail to meet a self-imposed deadline for the completion
of his work, it is clear that he anticipated an earlier filing date
and that Montesclaros was to have been the living, current example
of the exemplary viceroy that Guaman Poma wished to commend to king
Philip III.</span></p>

made after Guaman Poma initially &ldquo;completed&rdquo; his book,
it is impossible to determine with certainty whether he prepared it
in Lucanas or later in Lima. Because of Guaman Poma&rsquo;s
knowledge of the mining area, he did not need the new sources of

recommendations for reform. Through its construction and incessant
updating and correction, the &ldquo;Buen gobierno&rdquo; chapter
makes plain the principal purpose of the work that Guaman Poma
announced from Santiago de Chipao in February 1615. All additions
of sheets to the completed manuscript, as well as the single
excision from it, occur in the <i>Buen gobierno</i>. More than any
other kind of evidence or argument, these emendations underscore
the signal importance of this longest portion of the book and its

continued to work over this central &ldquo;buen gobierno&rdquo;

Dissatisfied with his original account of Montesclaros, he replaced
the viceroy&rsquo;s earlier pictorial and prose portrait. Upon
discovering his oversight of the rule of Don Fernando de Torres y
Portugal, he added a single sheet to the quire to accommodate
Torres&rsquo; presentation as the sixth viceroy (actually, he was
the seventh) and increased by one the number in sequence of the
four that followed. Discovering subsequently that he had overlooked
altogether the tenure of the Count of Nieva, he entered that
information at the lower margin of his first viceregal portrait,
that of Antonio de Mendoza (actual page 438), and continued by
adding a note on the inclusive years of rule of each successive
viceroy at the bottom of the respective portrait pages, thus
covering all but one omission that would remain in perpetuity (the
governorship of Lope Garc&iacute;a de Castro), and concluding by
acknowledging that Montesclaros&rsquo; tenure as viceroy ended in
1615. We know that Guaman Poma made these precise, final
corrections not in provincial Lucanas but rather in Lima, near or
at the viceregal court, as he prepared to deposit his

Poma&rsquo;s hope that the monarch would welcome an assessment of
his most highly ranked surrogates, and that it would be appropriate

The consideration of the codicological evidence that the autograph
manuscript presents brings forth one entirely new dimension about
Guaman Poma&rsquo;s execution of his work. While we are familiar
with Guaman Poma as an artist who also plays the role of author, or
vice versa, the codicological inquiry teaches us what it means for
that artist and author to serve as his own scribe. As he handles
innumerable and difficult choices, we discover not the ineptitude
of a self-taught Andean amateur, but an author and artist in
control of his own medium.</a></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">It was as
his own scribe that Guaman Poma had to deal with the challenge of
diminishing material resources. If we think of<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> the scribe&rsquo;s task in making
decisions in the face of a paper shortage, we can better understand
a number of apparent contradictions within the <i>Nueva
cor&oacute;nica y buen gobierno</i> manuscript. We can appreciate
why some texts were updated or augmented and others were not.
Glancing back at the late sheets additions and their contents
surveyed in Section 4.1, the close reader will not be surprised
that the topics of the parish priests (which occupies the longest
chapter in the book), native Andean society, the moral
&ldquo;Considerations,&rdquo; the dialogue with the king, and
commentary on the silver mines of Potos&iacute;, all have been the
beneficiaries of additional though limited resources. By these
lights, the acquisition of eighteen single, or nine double, sheets
needed to produce the thirty-six pages of &ldquo;Camina el
autor&rdquo; must have provided a considerable
challenge.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">At the
same time, bringing the &ldquo;Tabla de la dicha
cor&oacute;nica&rdquo; up to date would have required two double
sheets, but Guaman Poma did not undertake that
revision.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> The evidence
suggests that at a late stage of his work, he gave a lower priority
to the accuracy of the information presented in the
&ldquo;Tabla.&rdquo; Likewise, as a possible consequence of his
decision not to update it, he invested less care in maintaining the
overall accuracy of the pagination in the body of the book. It is
possible either that he postponed a full proof-reading of his
pagination and then later found himself unable to complete it, or
that he decided not to make further corrections, knowing that his
own page numbers would not be reproduced in any printed version of
his manuscript. (Pagination, as we saw above, was merely <i>one</i>
of the means by which Guaman Poma attempted to guarantee the
intelligibility of the codex&rsquo;s proper sequencing.) Whatever
the case might have been, the low priority he now gave to
pagination made room for his esthetic considerations.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Oddly
enough, Guaman Poma&rsquo;s most egregious &ldquo;errors&rdquo; in
pagination may be the result of his esthetic predilections. This
phenomenon serves as a final demonstration of his treatment of
competing priorities in a time of scarcity. Just as his graphic
sensibility prevented him, as his own scribe, from marring his
&ldquo;Tabla&rdquo; with repeated layers of corrections, so too it
overruled his desire, as an author, to achieve a pedantically
accurate control of his modified pagination. Thus, as we saw above
regarding the 986-cum-996 adjustment and the following
repagination, Guaman Poma consciously but silently
&ldquo;overlooked&rdquo; the misnumbering of hundreds of pages,
from 537 to 1003, and, on the 124 pages that he did renumber
(actual pages 1004-1178, excepting pages 1066-1067 and 1104-1139 on
Potos&iacute; and &ldquo;Camina el autor&rdquo;), his activity
consisted not of adding new, easily legible page numbers, but
rather of &ldquo;grafting&rdquo; the correct digits onto the old
page numbers, making as few deletions and smudges as
possible.</span></p>
<p class="HTMLBody"><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">Guided more
by esthetic than by arithmetical principles, Guaman Poma smoothly
and correctly executed the conversion of old page numbers to new
ones. Since he did so rather mechanically, more for his own benefit
as redactor than for the convenience of any future
readers&mdash;and hence without the redundant accuracy that
otherwise characterized his writing&mdash;he produced whole series
of page numbers that were &ldquo;misspelled,&rdquo; resulting in
hybrid and impossible numbers such as 11010 and 11102 instead of
1110 and 1112, created by the wrong insertion of a zero (see actual
pages 1120 and 1122). The last digits, nevertheless, are invariably
correct, thus allowing for identification of interpolated or
excised material. At the same time, the digits in the tens of
thousands, inaccurately</span><span lang="EN-US" xml:lang=
"EN-US">substituting for numbers in the thousands, tend to comply
first and foremost with the esthetic principle of making the least
intrusive corrections possible by refraining from writing over and
blurring the extant numbers. Hence, for example, on actual page
1146, wanting to raise 1090 by 10, Guaman Poma changed this figure
to 11010 (instead of 1100), by adding &ldquo;1&rdquo; in front and
changing the &ldquo;9&rdquo; to a &ldquo;1.&rdquo; (He subsequently
raised this new number by 36 to 11036, instead of to 1136, by
overwriting the old &ldquo;9/1&rdquo; with a &ldquo;3&rdquo; and
extending the circle of the last &ldquo;0&rdquo; to turn it into a
&ldquo;6.&rdquo;)</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">We can imagine that it was at
this point that Guaman Poma reconsidered the balance between the
two focal points of his tandem project. Late revisions and inserted
sheets aside, even by the datum of sheer page count the <i>Buen
gobierno</i> exceeded the length of the <i>Nueva
cor&oacute;nica</i> by several hundred pages, occupying almost
two-thirds of the work. Did Guaman Poma decide that the balance had
shifted, emphasizing, when all was said and done, the treatise on
good governance over the treatment of Andean history?<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> If this were the case, then
&ldquo;history&rdquo; might no longer be an equal partner, of
interest for its own sake, but rather an instrumental tool within
the larger work.</span></p>

<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">This &ldquo;tool&rdquo; could
serve to establish his credibility as princely adviser by
demonstrating his own base of knowledge in the society for which he
sought to serve as advocate. It could also, as I have demonstrated
elsewhere (Adorno 2000), &ldquo;rewrite history&rdquo; so as to
make its course conform to the goals that Guaman Poma sought for
the redress of personal and societal grievances and the return of
Andean sovereignty. In this regard, perhaps he found that his
chronicle ought not to be described as &ldquo;first and new,&rdquo;
in which &ldquo;first&rdquo; and &ldquo;new&rdquo; carried
synonymous or equivalent weight,<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> but rather as the &ldquo;first
new chronicle,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;first of the new
chronicles,&rdquo; which proclaimed its primacy in a new hierarchy
of historico-literary values. It suggests, in part, that Guaman
Poma viewed his work as the inauguration of a new departure in
chronicle-writing that would correct the earlier, European-authored
versions of Inka and Spanish conquest histories of Peru. His
critical review of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>
previous chronicles (chapter 34) bears out this interpretation of
his cryptic title insofar as it includes an implicit (but not
subtle) defense of his own work.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style=

<span lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">The notion of historiographic
&ldquo;newness&rdquo; as the combination of two, distinctive
generic entities had been suggested by the Jesuit Jos&eacute; de
Acosta with whose works Guaman Poma was familiar.<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> Acosta (1962, 13) had called his
own 1588 <i>Historia natural y moral de las Indias</i>
&ldquo;new&rdquo; because it was in part &ldquo;history and in part
philosophy.&rdquo; With or without Acosta as a guide (Guaman Poma
referred to Acosta&rsquo;s other works, not the <i>Historia</i>
that contains the assertion), the notion of &ldquo;newness&rdquo;
representing something that was a hybrid or result of a mixture
would not have been unfamiliar to Guaman Poma.&nbsp;</span></p>

xml:lang="EN-US">In Guaman Poma&rsquo;s case, the &ldquo;first of
the new chronicles&rdquo; could also be construed, in part, as the
history that directly served the cause of justice. And that cause
had taken shape in the elaboration and emendation of the <i>Buen
gobierno</i>. It is in this regard that the partial identification
of Guaman Poma&rsquo;s work as an <i>arbitrio</i> bears
mention.</span>

xml:lang="EN-US">From our vantage point today, the interest that
Guaman Poma&rsquo;s work arouses is in the cultural domain, that
is, in his handling of the institutions and conventions of Andean
culture vis-&agrave;-vis his manipulation of those of<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> Spanish and European culture. One
of the areas long ago mentioned but insufficiently developed on the
European &ldquo;side&rdquo; of Guaman Poma&rsquo;s cultural
repertoire is the relationship of his work to those of advisement
to the king on political, administrative, and economic matters.
Guaman Poma&rsquo;s proposals for reform constitute the backbone of
his book, which he located within the literary tradition of counsel
to the prince (Adorno 1974, 151-155). While elements representing a
range of European artistic conventions and literary genres have
been identified in Guaman Poma&rsquo;s work, <span style=
"color:black">from Renaissance biography to Counter-Reformational
sermons (Adorno 2000), perhaps the model that best serves to
classify it according to the lights of<span style=
"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span> its own day is, in the end, the
<i>arbitrio.</i> I emphasize &ldquo;in the end&rdquo; because the
work&rsquo;s definition took shape as a dynamic process; we see
that Guaman Poma worked unceasingly at developing and emending its
contents, as I have described them throughout this
paper.</span></span></p>

seventeenth century to treatises offering proposals for fiscal
reform to save Spain from the economic ruin into which it was
plummeting. The authors of such works were referred to, not always
flatteringly, as <i>arbitristas</i>. They included lawyers,
clerics, merchants, royal officials or &ldquo;plain
adventurers,&rdquo; all of whom saw themselves as men of special
social responsibility. Their approaches varied, from advocating
economic or fiscal reform to proposing new mental attitudes deemed
necessary if new sources of wealth were to be generated. (Guaman
Poma fits in here.) No matter how grave the
<i>arbitristas&rsquo;</i> assessment of the situation at hand,
argues British historian Sir John Elliott (1986, 88-89), all of
them were &ldquo;imbued with the belief that something must, and
could, be done.&rdquo;</span></p>

not only justice for the Andean people (Guaman Poma&rsquo;s first
cause) but also the Spanish monarchy&rsquo;s greater economic good
(his most insistent rhetorical argument), the <i>arbitrio</i>

notion of the <i>arbitrio</i> underscores the potential interest of
the <i>Nueva cor&oacute;nica y buen gobierno</i> in its focus on
governmental and administrative affairs. It &ldquo;makes

articulation of picture and prose to that of chapter and prologue,
reveal the complexity and coherence of his conceptualization, as
author and artist, and his success as his own scribe. In this
regard</span>, the coordination of codicological and textual
evidence provides more than insight into aspects of the
work&rsquo;s conceptualization, now frozen in time, or even its
systematic emendation, for the sake of charting one-time
corrections and expansions. The codicological evidence in
conjunction with the textual testimony give voice to the silent but
dynamic process through which the <i>Nueva cor&oacute;nica y buen
gobierno</i> gives an account of its material assembly and
substantive realization. Together, these mutually supportive
procedures turn the dead artifact into a living text and allow it
to perform the juridically impossible act of being a &ldquo;witness

    <h2>Rolena Adorno: Guaman Poma, &#x201C;interpreter of this inspection&#x201D;</h2>
    <p>The <i>composici&#xF3;n de tierras</i> is a transaction, carried out by the Spanish colonial state, that confirmed land titles. In the actions in which Guaman Poma participated and which were executed by Don Gabriel Solana de Figueroa, Inspector Judge of the jurisdiction of Huamanga, titles were confirmed not only to Spanish settlers but also to native Andeans.</p>
    <p>The document presented here is one of many that attests to the official administrative duties of Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala as an interpreter in confirmation of land-title proceedings in Huamanga during the last decade of the sixteenth century. As the Lic. Nelson Pereyra Ch&#xE1;vez, who found, transcribed, and published the document, points out, the references to officials and residents of the area criss-cross one another in the triangulation that exists among these proceedings, those of the Expediente Prado Tello, and the Nueva cor&#xF3;nica y buen gobierno itself (all three are reproduced on this website). Pereyra Ch&#xE1;vez illuminates Guaman Poma&#x2019;s role: He is the assistant of the Spanish inspector Gabriel Solano de Figueroa, in whose absence Guaman Poma carries out the inspection of the contested properties, describing the lands and fixing their borders and limits. Between the 10th and the 20th of September, 1594, when Guaman Poma received his orders and filed his report, respectively, he partipated in another action: When Solano de Figueroa upheld the titles of certain Andean servants (yanaconas) of Diego Gavil&#xE1;n to lands in the Tortora valley of Huamanga, it was Guaman Poma, &#x201C;interpreter of this inspection,&#x201D; who gave them the notification; these actions occurred on September 16 and 17, 1594, respectively, and they are commented upon by Zorrilla (1977:50) and Stern (1978:226).</p>
    <p>For a summary of Guaman Poma&#x2019;s documented activities and an analysis of the contents of the Expediente Prado Tello and its relationship to Guaman Poma&#x2019;s chronicle, see, respectively, Rolena Adorno, &#x201C;Guaman Poma and His Illustrated Chronicle from Colonial Peru&#x201D; and &#x201C;The Genesis of the <i>Nueva cor&#xF3;nica y buen gobierno</i>,&#x201D; both of which appear on this website.</p>
    <p>The document here transcribed (Secci&#xF3;n Corregimiento, Serie Asuntos Administrativos, Legajo 39, a&#xF1;os 1594-1771, fols. 1-7) was photographed by Ivan Boserup of the Royal Library, Copenhagen, at the Archivo Departamental de Ayacucho, Ayacucho, Peru, on 20 July 2003, with the generous permission of the Archive&#x2019;s Director, Mr. Venturo Guerrero Anaya, and the kind asistance of his colleague, Virgilio Guti&#xE9;rrez Orellana. The collaboration of the historian Nelson Pereyra Ch&#xE1;vez and especially the kindness of Mr. Jefrey Gamarra Carrillo, Director of the School of Archaeology and History of the Universidad Nacional de San Crist&#xF3;bal de Huamanga, Ayacucho, Peru, are also gratefully recognized.</p>
    <p><i>Nota bene</i>: In the digitalized facsimile, some lines of the royal decree regarding land-title confirmation have not been scanned (end of folio 1 recto, beginning of 2 recto, end of 2 verso/beginning of 3 recto), but they are faithfully transcribed by Lic. Pereyra Ch&#xE1;vez on his pages 265 and 266. Also missing are the words, &#x201C;[Gua]manga y su jurisdicci&#xF3;n en nombre de Cathalina Patta natural de la dicha&#x201D;, from the Presentation by the Protector of Indians, Esteban de Vega, at the juncture of folios 3 verso y 4 recto; these are transcribed on page 267 of the Lic. Pereyra Ch&#xE1;vez&#x2019;s article. All other folios of the digitized document are complete.</p>

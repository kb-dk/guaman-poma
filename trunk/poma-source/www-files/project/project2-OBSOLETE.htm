            <h2>Digitizing Guaman Poma's <i>Nueva cor&#xF3;nica y buen gobierno</i>: about the project.</h2>
            <p>When the Royal Library of Denmark, in May 1997 nominated the autograph manuscript of Guaman Poma&#x2019;s <i>Nueva cor&#xF3;nica y buen gobierno</i> (Gl. kgl. S. 2232, 4&#xBA;) for inclusion in UNESCO's "<a href="http://www.unesco.org/webworld/nominations/en/denmark_treasures/denmark4.htm#Consultation">Memory of the world</a>" list, it was stated that due to the physical condition of preservation of this unique historical document, "any kind of use or display etc. is prohibited." And since none of the existing facsimile editions, all going back to the Paris facsimile of 1936, complies with modern standards of reproduction, it was equally stated that "digitization is under consideration."</p>
            <p>The Department of Manuscript and Rare Books initiated a digitization program in 1998. After two years of experiments, resulting in the publication on Internet of ca. 35 digital facsimiles (ca. 5000 pages) of manuscripts, of varying age and complexity, it was decided, in September 2000, to go forward with the present project.</p>
            <p>The autograph manuscript of Guman Poma consists of nearly 1200 pages, including 398 full page drawings. It was decided that the text pages should be made readable and that it should be possible to view (and print) the drawings in two sizes. Navigation helps, indexes and a list of drawings should make it possible to browse through the manuscript or easily find particular pages or drawings. Furthermore, the presentation should be throughout in Spanish and in English.</p>
            <p>Finally, it was decided that high-resolution colour diapositives of the drawings of Guaman Poma should be made ready for purchase simultaneously with the opening of the website, scheduled for May 2001.</p>
            <p>The resulting website is the result of international cooperation:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Rolena Adorno, professor of Latin American Literature at Yale University, agreed to act as scholarly consultant to the whole project. She has, together with her research asistants John Charles and Fernanda Macchi, as the project progressed comtributed to the website with a number of important enhancements: an introductory Essay and review of recent scholarship on the author and his manuscript and a Descriptive List of all 398 drawings.<br/></li>
              <li>Guadalupe Ortiz Elguea, General manager of the publishing house <a href="http://www.sigloxxi-editores.com.mx/"><i>Siglo Veintiuno Editores</i></a>, Mexico City, has agreed to allow the Indexes of <a onclick="window.open('siglo.htm','','toolbar=no,location=no,directories=no,status=yes,menubar=no,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,copyhistory=no,width=750,height=625');return false" target="_blank" href="siglo.htm">the critical edition of Guaman Poma's work</a> (Mexico City, 1980), to be reproduced in the present Internet edition.<br/></li>
              <li>At the Royal Library, the digitization, design and implementation of the Internet edition has been carried out by Bruno Svindborg, research librarian in the Manuscript Department. Image control, enhancement and storing was done by J&#xF8;rgen Byberg Hansen, assistant in the Department of Digitization and Web Publishing, and Peter Nyboe Rasmussen, IT-consultant in the same department, has been responsible for the enhancements that had to be implemented for the present project in the ORACLE application that was originally set up to run the display of digital facsimiles of manuscripts on the website of the Royal Library.<br/></li>
              <li>Ivan Boserup, Head of the Department of Manuscripts and Rare Books, has coordinated and directed the project.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In connection with the opening of the present website, the Royal Library has published (in book-form) a bilingual introduction to and survey of recent research on Guaman Poma and his Cor&#xF3;nica: <i>Guaman Poma and His Illustrated Chronicle from Colonial Peru</i>, by professor Rolena Adorno (<a href="http://www.mtp.dk/"><i>Museum Tusculanum Press. University of Copenhagen</i></a>). It comprises professor Adorno&#x2019;s Essay written for the present Internet edition, her transcription and translation of Guaman Poma's letter to King Philip III of Spain announcing the completion of his work, maps of Peru and 15 colour plates of selected drawings.</p>

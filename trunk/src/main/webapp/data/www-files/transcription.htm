This transcription of <i>El primer nueva cor&#xF3;nica y buen gobierno</i> is based on the examination of the autograph manuscript carried out by Rolena Adorno in 1977 as well as the print editions prepared by John V. Murra, Rolena Adorno, and Jorge L. Urioste in 1980 (Mexico City: Siglo Veintiuno Editores) and 1987 (Madrid: Historia-16). In addition to the corrections to the transcription made in 1987, we add here many more, significant ones, made on the basis of the close examination of the digital reproductin of GkS 2232 4&#xBA;, after its inauguration on the Internet on 15 May 2001. From that date onward, Ivan Boserup, Keeper of Manuscripts and Rare Books at the Royal Library in Copenhagen, and Rolena Adorno made a systematic review of the digitized facsimile, and the results of their investigation are incorporated into the transcription presented here.</p>
    <p>The original design for the presentation of the text and its critical apparatus is owed to Mart&#xED; Soler, of Siglo Veintiuno, who supervised the production of the first edition of 1980 with exemplary care. That design was utilized in the 1987 Madrid edition, and we modify it slightly now, thanks to advances in the presentation of textual materials made possible by the electronic medium.</p>
    <p>The critical annotation to the text reproduces the version prepared in 1980 and augmented in 1987, with regard to ethnographic, ethnological, historical, linguistic, and literary, etc., themes. The only new notes presented in this electronic edition are the result of the recent study by Boserup and Adorno of the characteristics of the manuscript and the elaboration of its texts.</p>
    <p>The ethnological index, the onomastic, toponymic and ethnic-group index, along with the glossary-index of Quechua words, are reproduced from the 1980 edition, thanks to the permission granted by Guadalupe Ortiz Elguea, of Siglo Veintiuno.</p>
    <p>The bibliography that appears below includes the sources cited in this edition as well as references to pertinent documents and studies, either made know or published since the Madrid edition of 1987. Although augmented, this bibliographic list does not pretend to be exhaustive but rather to take into account the investigations that continue to be carried out on the life and work of Guaman Poma and his contributions to the knowledge of the Andean world.</p>
    <p>The introductory essays that Murra, Adorno, and Urioste prepared for the editions of 1980 and 1987, respectively, are six in number. Their objectives, in 1980, were to offer ethnological (Murra) and linguistic (Urioste) perspectives on the content of the Nueva cor&#xF3;nica y buen gobierno as well as to present a detailed account of Guaman Poma&#x2019;s composition and correction of the final manuscript (Adorno). All three essays had in mind a limited public of specialized, primarily Latinamericanist, readers. Upon accepting the invitation of Javier Villalba, executive director of Historia-16, and Manuel Ballesteros Gaibrois, director of the collection, to include our edition in the &#x201C;Cr&#xF3;nicas de Am&#xE9;rica&#x201D; series (an invitation we could accept, thanks to the generosity of Siglo Veintiuno and the good offices of Mart&#xED; Soler), it seemed useful to us to write new introductory essays. This time we did it for a European reading public on the eve of the Fifth Cententary of Columbus&#x2019;s first voyage, and we attempted to cover, in more global and/or contextualized terms, the themes of the life and work of Guaman Poma (Adorno), his outlook on the Andean world of past and present (Murra), and the variety of his Quechua texts and the character of his written Spanish (Urioste). All six essays will be available on this website.</p>
